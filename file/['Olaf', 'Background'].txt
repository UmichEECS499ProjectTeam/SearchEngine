"When
you
meet
your
ancestors,
tell
them
Olaf
sent
you."
â€•
"Beware
the
war
cry
of
the
Berserker.
What
surges
toward
you
is
unyielding,
free
from
the
shackles
of
reason."
"Leave
nothing
behind!"
"Faster
to
battle!"
"Chop
chop!"
"My
axe
is
thirsty."
"Finally,
some
fun!"
"Death
by
steel!"
"Obliteration!"
"The
might
of
Lokfar
approaches!"
"To
plunder!"
"To
action!"
"I'm
going."
"Urge
to
kill,
rising!"
"C'mon,
I
won't
hurt
you.
I
promise!"
"The
worth
of
a
man
can
be
measured
by
the
length
of
his
beard,
and
the
girth
of
his
belt
buckle."
Olaf
laughs.
Olaf
laughs.
Olaf
laughs.
Olaf
laughs.
"Out
of
the
way,
loser!"
"Beatdown
city.
Population:
you."
"Get
on
the
pain
train,
woo
woo!"
"Come
get
some!"
"I
am
Broseidon,
lord
of
the
Brocean."
"Do
you
got
that
bro?"
"HEY!
Don't
touch
my
Graggy
Ice!"
"Brohoho."
"Oh
man...
where
am
I?"
"Dude,
I'm
so
buffed
up
right
now."
"Hey
dude,
I'm
kind
of
a
big
deal."
"Chicks
dig
my
axe."
"That's
how
I
roll."
"Up
top."
"Point
me
to
the
ladies!"
"Holla'
atcha'
boy!"
"What
up?"
"You
can't
arrest
me,
my
dad
owns
a
dealership!"
"I
came
here
to
kick
butt
and
drink
Graggy!
Looks
like
I'm
all
out
of
Graggy."
"I'm
OP?
Your
mom
is
OP."
"Yo,
summoner,
summon
me
like
two...

SIX
hot
chicks,

"Brohoho."
"Brohooo!"
"Bro!"
"Brohooo!"
"Chug!"
"Chug!"
"Chug!"
"Chug!
Chug!"
"Bro!"
"Brohooo!"
"Broooooo!"
"Brohooo!"
"Oh

"Kaboom!"
"Kablooey!"
"Boom,

"Bromacia!"
"Bromacia!"
"Bromacia!"
"Bromacia!"
"Your
mom!"
"Lame!"
"Oh,
bogus!"'
"Dude,
not
cool..."
Olaf
was
designed
by
As
you
may
have
observed
throughout
your
time
in
Runeterra,
the
League
of
Legends
Design
Team
seeks
to
promote
synergy
whenever
possible
(like
a
boss).
Between
champions
with
guns,
champions
with
cultural
ties,
and
champions
under
five
feet
tall,
there
are
a
ton
of
ways
that
our
champions
synergize
with
one
another.
We
felt
that
the
champion,
,
however,
didn't
have
enough
kindred
spirits
at
his
disposal.
This
is
an
important
issue!
We're
talking
about
ensuring
that
an
important
subculture
in
the
League
of
Legends
gets
equal
representation!
That
subculture
is,
of
course:
vicious,
axe-wielding
maniacs.
To
bolster
the
ranks
of
this
often
under
appreciated
demographic,
we're
pleased
to
be
able
to
introduce
Olaf,
the
Berserker.
And
just
to
make
sure
he
fits
the
bill
exactly,
this
guy
actually
has
a
pair
of
axes.
So
strap
on
the
nearest
helmet,
sharpen
your
great
sword,
and
raise
an
ice
cold
flagon
of
mead
in
honor
of
Olaf,
the
latest
champion
to
grace
the
Field
of
Justice.
