Thresh
the
Chain
Warden
or
Release
date
Thresh
does
not
gain
per
.
Instead,
Thresh
collects
the
souls
of
dead
enemies
by
approaching
them
or
by
placing
Dark
Passage's
lantern
nearby.
Each
soul
permanently
grants
0.75
armor
and
.
Champions
and
large
and
always
drop
a
soul.
Small
minions
and
monsters
only
sometimes
drop
a
soul.
A
soul
will
only
drop
if
the
enemy
unit
dies
within
1900
range
of
Thresh.
Souls
are
visible
to
allies,
and
only
become
visible
to
enemies
if
the
enemy
team
has
vision
of
Thresh.
Souls
disappear
if
not
picked
up
after
14
seconds.
Additional
Information:
After
a
0.
second
wind-up,
Thresh
throws
out
his
scythe
in
a
line
and
forms
a
tether
with
the
first
enemy
hit,
dealing
and
it
for
1.
seconds.
Upon
hitting
an
enemy,
Death
Sentence's
current
is
reduced
by
3
seconds.
While
the
tether
persists,
Thresh
cannot
attack
and
he
will
periodically
tug
on
the
tether,
each
time
pulling
the
target
a
short
distance
toward
himself.
After
0.
seconds,
or
instantly
if
he
hooks
a
minion
or
monster,
Thresh
can
reactivate
the
ability
to
use
Death
Leap.
Thresh
pulls
himself
to
the
bound
enemy.
This
removes
the
stun
but
allows
Thresh
to
attack
again.
Thresh
loses
the
ability
to
activate
Death
Leap
when
the
tether
breaks.
Thresh
throws
his
lantern
to
the
target
location
where
it
remains
for
up
to
6
seconds.
If
an
ally
right-clicks
the
lantern,
they
will
pick
it
up
and
will
be
pulled
to
Thresh's
location.
If
Thresh
moves
more
than
~1500
units
away,
the
lantern
will
return
to
him.
For
the
next
6
seconds,
allies
who
come
near
the
lantern
(even
while
Thresh
is
holding
it)
gain
a
shield
that
absorbs
damage
for
up
to
4
seconds.
Allies
can
only
receive
the
shield
once
per
cast.
Additional
Information:
Thresh's
basic
attacks
deal
bonus
magic
damage
on
each
hit.
This
value
is
equal
to
the
total
number
of
souls
collected,
plus
a
percentage
of
his
attack
damage
based
on
the
amount
of
time
since
his
last
attack.
Thresh
sweeps
his
chain
in
a
broad
line
towards
a
target
direction.
Enemies
hit
take
magic
damage,
are
knocked
in
the
same
direction
as
the
chains,
and
are
slowed
afterwards
for
1.
seconds.
Additional
Information:
After
a
0.
second
delay,
Thresh
summons
5
spectral
walls
around
him
that
last
up
to
5
seconds.
Enemy
champions
that
touch
a
wall
take
magic
damage
and
are
slowed
by
99%
for
2
seconds,
but
break
the
wall.
Once
one
wall
is
broken,
the
remaining
walls
deal
half
damage
and
apply
half
the
slow
duration.
An
enemy
can
be
affected
by
multiple
walls.
