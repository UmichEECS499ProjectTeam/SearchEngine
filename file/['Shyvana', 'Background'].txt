humans
pose?"

Out

Shyvana
was
designed
by
Eventually
everyone
has
one
of
those
moments
where
life
throws
them
a
curve
ball
and
they
learn
that
you
sometimes
meet
people
who
are
full
of
surprises.
So,
when
we
first
ran
into
Shyvana,
the
Half-Dragon,
suffice
to
say
we
were
rather
taken
aback
indeed
when
we
saw
her
actually
transform
into
a
dragon.
So
unless
you're
a
truly
incorrigible
herpetophobic,
we're
confident
that
you'll
find
that
not
all
surprises
have
to
be
unpleasant.
For
this
mechanics
preview,
we
wanted
to
focus
less
on
the
individual
abilities
of
our
upcoming
champion
and
talk
about
the
skillset
and
character
flow
of
Shyvana,
the
Half
Dragon,
as
a
whole.
Shyvana
is
a
melee
champion
that
heavily
rewards
aggression.
She
does
so
by
utilizing
a
modified
Fury*
resource
that
accrues
anytime
Shyvana
lands
an
auto-attack.
Once
her
Fury*
is
full,
she
can
unleash
it
to
transform
into
a
dragon,
giving
her
substantial
buffs,
ability
enhancements
and
some
upfront
damage.
While
in
dragon
form,
Shyvana's
Fury*
is
slowly
consumed,
though
she
can
continue
auto-attacking
to
extend
the
duration
of
the
Dragon
From
and
maximize
her
damage
output
with
each
use.
It's
also
worth
mentioning
that
Shyvana's
ultimate
has
no
cooldown,
but
can
only
be
used
when
her
reserve
of
Fury*
is
full.
The
right
set
of
circumstances
can
allow
a
skilled
player
to
transform
much
more
often
than
other
would
otherwise
be
possible.
In
addition,
all
of
Shyvana's
abilities
also
have
benefits
that
trigger
when
she
auto-attacks.
This
is
to
differentiate
her
from
the
"melee
caster"
paradigm
embodied
by
some
other
characters,
making
her
play
somewhere
between
an
Attack
Damage
carry
and
a
fighter.
Simply
put,
Shyvana
is
for
players
who
like
any
of
the
following:
Offensive,
aggressive
playstyles
Melee
carries
or
fighters
The
idea
of
being
a
super-rad
dragon
We
think
this
wantonly
aggressive
playstyle
is
something
we
haven't
seen
previously
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
It's
an
exciting
opportunity
for
players
to
experience
a
new
way
to
play
League
of
Legends.
Note:
Fury
was
originally
mislabeled
as
"Dragon’s
Blood".
