Rengar
never
knew
his
real
parents,
but
was
raised
by
a
human
who
was
revered
as
a
legendary
hunter.
He
was
an
ideal
pupil,
intently
absorbing
the
lessons
of
his
father,
and
improving
them
with
his
uncanny
feral
instincts.
Before
his
mane
had
fully
grown,
Rengar
set
off
on
his
own
and
claimed
a
wide
territory
for
himself.
Along
its
perimeter,
he
mounted
the
skulls
of
his
slain
prey
-
a
warning
to
would-be
aggressors.
He
thought
undisputed
reign
of
a
region
would
fulfill
him,
but
instead,
he
grew
restless.
No
beasts
in
his
domain
proved
challenging
prey,
and
without
formidable
adversaries
to
push
his
limits,
Rengar's
spirit
waned.
He
feared
that
no
worthwhile
game
remained,
that
he
would
never
again
feel
the
thrill
of
the
hunt.
Just
when
things
seemed
their
bleakest,
he
encountered
.
It
was
a
disturbing,
alien
thing,
distinctly
out
of
place
in
his
.
It
bore
huge
scything
claws
and
devoured
any
animal
that
strayed
across
its
path.
Overzealous
at
the
prospect
of
a
challenge,
Rengar
ambushed
the
monster
in
haste.
It
far
outclassed
anything
he'd
hunted
before.
Their
fight
was
savage,
and
each
suffered
crippling
wounds.
Rengar
lost
an
eye,
but
the
most
grievous
blow
was
to
his
pride.
He
had
never
before
failed
to
make
the
kill.
Worse
yet,
the
severity
of
his
injuries
forced
him
to
retreat.
Over
the
following
days,
he
hovered
on
the
threshold
between
life
and
death.
He
was
wracked
with
pain,
but
beneath
it,
he
felt
a
glimmer
of
joy.
The
hunt
was
on.
If
such
powerful
beings
existed
in
the
world,
he
would
find
them,
and
stack
their
heads
high.
The
monster,
however,
was
a
kill
he
wanted
to
savor.
On
his
den's
largest
wall,
he
reserves
a
space
for
the
beast's
head,
a
trophy
he
swears
will
one
day
be
the
centerpiece
of
his
collection.

On
every
wall
of
his
den,
the
trophy
hunter
Rengar
mounts
the
heads,
horns,
claws,
and
fangs
of
the
most
lethal
creatures
in
.
Though
his
collection
is
extensive,
he
remains
unsatisfied,
tirelessly
seeking
greater
game.
He
takes
time
with
every
kill,
studying
his
prey,
learning,
and
preparing
himself
for
the
next
encounter
with
the
he
never
managed
to
defeat.
Valoran
―
"Prey
on
the
weak
and
you
will
survive,
prey
on
the
strong
and
you
will
live."
"Tonight
we
hunt!"
"Walk
the
killer's
path."
"I
seek
only
the
strongest."
"Catch
their
trail."
"Comfort
breeds
weakness."
"A
true
hunter
never
rests."
"The
scent
of
prey."
"Monsters
can
be
made
to
fear."
"Strike
when
ready."
"There
is
the
hunter
and
the
hunted."
"Whose
head
shall
I
take?"
"A
fitting
prize."
"Nothing
will
escape."
"Carve
off
a
souvenir."
"Another
piece
for
my
collection."
"Their
heads
will
adorn
my
wall."
"Lesser
creature."
"Let's
see
what
they're
made
of."
"All
these
trophies...
I'm
gonna
need
a
bigger
den!"
"So
much
bloodshed...
This
is
my
kind
of
place!"
"You
have
a
warrior's
heart.
I
think
I'll
take
it."
"You've
earned
a
good
death.
I've
earned
the
kill."
Rengar
laughs.
Rengar
laughs.
Rengar
laughs.
"Each
trophy,
a
victory."
"Remember
every
kill."
"Spoils
of
the
hunt."
"Never
return
empty-handed."
"A
token
of
my
conquests."
"I'm
just
getting
started."
"A
fine
collection."
"More
prey,
more
prizes."
"Leave
only
a
trail
of
bodies."
"What
a
glorious
hunt."
"Come
on!"
"Let's
fight!"
"Not
so
fast!"
"Slow
down!"
"Don't
trip."
"Easy
prey."
"Listen."
"Focus."
"I
see
you,
wretched
creature!"
"I
found
you,
beast!"
Your
enemy's
heart
beats
nervously,
pumping
faster
as
you
approach.
The
time
is
right
for
the
perfect
strike,
that
split-second
when
your
victim
thinks
no
one
has
followed.
Whether
you
meet
Rengar
face-to-face
on
the
battlefield
or
back-to-blade
during
the
hunt,
you're
never
alone
and
never
safe
when
the
Pridestalker's
chosen
you
as
his
trophy.
The
ultimate
predator‘s
many
things:
methodical,
determined,
and
unrelenting.
Meet
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker,
one
of
the
most-feared
hunters
in
all
of
Valoran,
whether
he’s
slashing
his
way
through
foes
or
leaping
from
the
shadows
of
the
brush
to
take
enemies
by
surprise.
Rengar’s
monstrous,
most-sought
prize,
however,
remains
at
large,
missing
from
the
Pridestalker’s
impressive
trophy
wall.
As
a
top-laner
or
jungler,
Rengar’s
brutal
strikes
and
roars
tear
through
his
enemies.
When
you
use
any
of
his
abilities
on
an
enemy,
you
generate
a
point
of
Ferocity.
Once
you’ve
stored
five
Ferocity
points,
Rengar’s
skills
become
available
instantly
and
the
next
skill
activated
gains
a
powerful
new
secondary
effect.
Players
will
have
to
strategically
manage
their
Ferocity,
activating
the
appropriate
ability
for
each
precarious
situation.
Rengar’s
passive
also
grants
his
auto
attack
a
leap
when
used
from
the
brush
or
while
invisible,
giving
this
apex
predator
immense
ganking
potential
from
hiding.
Rengar’s
ultimate
ability,
Thrill
of
the
Hunt,
grants
him
invisibility,
extra
movement
speed
and
Ferocity
points.
The
true
power
behind
Rengar’s
ultimate
is
his
visibility
of
enemies
under
the
fog
of
war.
Rengar
enters
an
all-consuming
hunting
mode,
allowing
him
to
see
enemy
locations
and
their
hearts
beating
faster
and
louder
as
he
closes
in.
No
hunter
would
be
whole
without
his
trophies
and
Rengar
is
no
stranger
to
collecting
the
prized
remains
of
his
downed
prey.
Playing
as
Rengar
grants
optional
access
to
the
Bonetooth
Necklace,
a
unique
store
item
that
collects
trophies
as
he
racks
up
kills
and
assists.
Slaying
enemies
will
increase
the
power
of
the
necklace
and
new
bonuses
unlock
when
trophy
thresholds
are
met.
You’re
never
forced
to
purchase
or
use
the
Bonetooth
Necklace,
but
are
rewarded
for
an
aggressive
playstyle
if
you
choose
to
use
it.
The
Fields
of
Justice
have
never
been
more
dangerous
than
when
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker,
prepares
for
the
hunt.
With
a
new
resource
system,
an
optional
item
in
the
shop,
and
a
dynamic
passive
that
interacts
when
he’s
stealthed
or
in
the
brush,
Rengar's
bringing
many
new
mechanics
to
strike
down
his
prey.
To
learn
more
about
these
new
mechanics,
we
went
straight
to
the
source
and
talked
to
about
Rengar's
kit.
In
order
to
bring
a
ruthless
hunter
like
Rengar
to
life,
the
designers
had
to
fuse
every
aspect
of
champion
design
into
a
predatory
experience
that
feels
as
ferocious
as
the
champion
himself.
Getting
players
inside
Rengar's
head
for
the
primal
hunt
was
the
biggest
challenge
in
his
creation.
What
began
as
a
tricky
proposition
eventually
became
a
compelling
champion
with
an
ultimate
ability
that
sums
up
the
brutal
and
methodical
Rengar
playstyle.
Don
your
Bonetooth
Necklace,
sharpen
your
claws,
and
stand
alert
to
your
enemies’
presence.
Now
it’s
time
to
take
control
and
prowl
through
the
jungle,
pounce
from
the
brush,
and
hunt
the
most
fearsome
prey
in
all
of
Valoran
as
Rengar,
the
Pridestalker!
How
do
you
make
Rengar
even
more
dangerous?
Add
a
gigantic
skull
to
his
shoulder
and
clad
the
Pridestalker
in
heavy
armor
to
deflect
the
gnashing
and
flailing
of
the
strongest
prey.
You’ll
also
get
new
effects
on
Savagery
and
Battle
Roar
for
even
more
brutality.
