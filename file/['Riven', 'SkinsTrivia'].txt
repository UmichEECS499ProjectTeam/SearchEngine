Riven's
backstory
and
name
also
resemble
Revan
from
the
game
Knights
Of
the
Old
Republic.
In
the
sequel
Knights
Of
the
Old
Republic
2
the
main
character

by

Xypherous
has
stated
that
the
original
pitch
for
Riven
was
"gooder
than
good".
Riven's
skill
set
is
inspired
by
move
set
from
the
game
.
Marth's

originally
from
Intelligent
Systems'
series.
After
the
release
of
Riven's
"Champion
Sneak
Peek",
there
was
a
preview
of
her
appearance
in
.
Riven's
"A
New
Champion
Approaches"
page

leaked

forum,
but
was
then
quickly
replaced
by

was
released
concurrently
with

of

is
based
on
the

Riven's
release
her
passive,
,

known
as

of

be
seen

He
also
animated
"The

While
using
her
ultimate
,
Riven
gains
an
additional
taunt
and
joke,
as
well
as
other
various
emotes.
Classic
Riven's
splash
art
was
revised
four
times
before
her
release,
causing
her
to
have
no
Art
Spotlight
before
her
release,
as
it
was
common
at
the
time
for
a
champion
to
have
one.
Redeemed
Riven's
sword
can
be
seen
in
the
preview
video
of
the
Mac
Version
of
League
of
Legends.
Riven
is
the
second
and
last
champion
to
receive
a
Crimson
Elite
skin,
the
first
being
Talon.
Crimson
Elite
was
the
counter
to
the
Demacian
Commando
skins
and
has
since
been
abandoned.
Riven
was
the
second
champion
to
have
a
special
skin
marking
the
end
of
Season
without
having
to
obtain
a
rank
of
Gold
or
higher
to
obtain,
the
first
being
Redeemed
Riven
is
likely
a
reference
to
her
former
backstory
in
which
Riven
was
an
exile
from
Demacia.
Her
armor
appears
similar
to
that
of
some
Demacian
champions.
Battle
Bunny
Riven
is
based
on
the
community-suggested
"Bunny
Girl
Riven"
from
this
and
,
which
themselves
were
based
on
.
During
an
ambush
on
troops,
launched
a
barrage
of
biochemical
terror
on
both
forces.
Riven
witnessed
as
around
her
Ionian
and
Noxian
alike
fell
victim
to
an
unspeakably
gruesome
fate.
This
incident
led
Riven
to
wander
in
self-imposed
exile,
seeking
atonement
and
searching
for
her
own
way
to
serve
the
pure
Noxian
vision
in
which
she
believed.
In
the
new
League
of
Legends
website,
Riven
is
listed
as
'
rival.
This
suggests
that
she
was
directly
involved
in
the
assault
of
Varus'
village
during
Noxus'
invasion
of
Ionia.
It
is
hinted
that
Riven
was
the
killer
of
the
Ionian
elder
that
was
supposed
to
protect.
