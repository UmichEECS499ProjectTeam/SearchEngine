On
a
faraway
world,
was
born
a
member
of
a
race
of
bestial
guardians
created
to
serve
as
the
rulers
and
protectors
of
their
people.
Alongside
his
brother
,
Renekton
oversaw
the
upkeep
of
the
Great
Library,
which
served
as
both
a
vault
of
ancient
knowledge
and
the
repository
of
the
teachings
of
the
Cycle
of
Life
and
Death.
While
the
enlightened
Nasus
taught
those
scholars
who
came
to
study,
Renekton
served
as
the
Great
Library's
gatekeeper.
He
could
sense
the
true
natures
of
those
who
sought
Nasus'
teachings,
and
he
sent
away
those
with
dark
ambitions.
Over
time,
however,
his
repeated
exposure
to
this
evil
infected
his
mind.
He
grew
furious
with
the
malevolence
in
the
hearts
of
men,
and
as
he
descended
deeper
into
madness,
he
discovered
he
could
quell
the
fury
by
cutting
the
evil
from
the
men
who
possessed
it.
Unfortunately,
the
relief
was
as
short-lived
as
the
subjects,
and
the
,
as
it
came
to
be
known,
would
resurge
even
stronger.
Consumed
by
his
anger,
Renekton
turned
on
the
one
being
who
could
defeat
him
--
his
own
brother.
Nasus
pleaded
with
Renekton
to
see
reason.
Realizing
that
he
was
beyond
redemption,
the
despondent
Nasus
valiantly
struck
down
his
wayward
sibling.
Defenseless,
Renekton
waited
eagerly
for
death's
release.
It
never
came.
He
was
spared
when
summoners
from
the
League
of
Legends
claimed
his
brother.
Caught
in
the
wake
of
this
powerful
spell,
Renekton
tumbled
for
what
seemed
like
ages
between
realities.
When
he
finally
emerged,
he
fell
deep
into
the
sewers
of
.
Insane
with
fury,
Renekton
languished
in
his
newfound
home,
driven
senseless
by
his
rage.
That
is
until,
by
happenstance,
he
caught
a
familiar
scent
in
the
air.
Believing
that
the
familiar
scent
would
guide
him
to
the
solace
that
was
fading
from
his
memory,
he
traced
his
brother
to
the

“My
brother
has
become
hollow.
Full
of
rage,
but
empty.”

"As
I
live,
all
will
die!"
"Cut
them
down!"
"Embrace
the
jaws
of
death."
"I'll
leave
them
in
pieces."
"Carnage!"
"Bask
in
their
blood!"
"Light

dark
meat,
it's
all
the
same."
"There
is
no
retreat."
"Welcome
the

"Destruction
approaches."
"Lavish
brutality."
"Chaos
will
follow."
"Who's
next
on
the
chopping
block?"
"Nothing
will
stop
me!"
"Nasus
cannot
escape
me
forever!"
"Come
back
when
you've
collected
all
the
bits
of
yourself!"
"What?
Do
I
have
someone
in
my
teeth?"

Lately,
we’ve
seen
quite
a
few
sibling
duos
enter
the
League
of
Legends.
While
and
may
have
been
the
first
to
make
membership
in
the
League
a
familial
affair,
since
then
and
have
been
making
a
point
of
highlighting
the
importance
of
good
genes.
Of
course,
not
all
families
get
along,
and
if
we’re
going
to
broach
the
subject
of
sibling
rivalry
there’s
probably
no
better
place
to
start
than
with
brother
Renekton,
the
Butcher
of
the
Sands.
We’re
personally
not
sure
that
we’ve
ever
seen
a
fraternal
relationship
with
more
animosity
(no
pun
intended).
