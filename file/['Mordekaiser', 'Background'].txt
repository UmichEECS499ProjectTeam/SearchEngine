Mordekaiser

making
the

"The
common
perception
is
that
the
encompassing
armor
protects
him,
I
fear
that
–
for
the
fragile
time
being
–
it
actually
protects
us."

"Fear
is
confusion,
pain
is
clarity."
"I
shall
bring
great
suffering!"
"Time
to
shred."
"How
delightfully
painful."
"No
pain,
no
drain."
"Carnage!"
"Your
sickness...
sustains
me."
"Affliction...
forever!"
"This
whole...
living
thing
is...
highly
overrated."
"Misery
loves
company."
"If
I
must."
"For
great...
torment!"
"We
shall
see."
"Desolation
is
coming."
"So
be
it...
summoner."
"You
only
need
to
click
once,
fool!"
"Death
would
be
too
good
for
the
likes
of
you!"
"I
like
my
weapons
how
I
like
my
music...
heavy
and
metal!"
Mordekaiser
laughs.
Mordekaiser
laughs.
Mordekaiser
laughs.
Mordekaiser
laughs.
"No..."
"Mordekaiser,
are
you
also
a
prisoner?"
"I
serve
you,
because
I
must,
Mordekaiser."
"I
serve
you
gladly,
Mordekaiser!"
"Free
me
my
lord
so
I
may
aid
you!"

Whether
you're
having
trouble
spotting
your
champion
during
those
hectic
team
fights,
or
you
just
happen
to
be
a
fan
of
awesome
juggernauts
in
massive
armor
carrying
gigantic
weapons,
we
may
have
a
solution
for
you.
Allow
me
to
introduce:
Mordekaiser.
If
you
have
ever
felt
that
your
champion's
aesthetic
could
be
vastly
improved
by
the
addition
of
plate
armor
covered
in
metal
spikes,
this
champion
should
definitely
scratch
that
itch.
