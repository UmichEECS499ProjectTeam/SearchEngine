Volibear,
the
Thunder's
Roar,
is
a
response
to
the
ongoing
joke
on
the
League
of
Legends
forums
regarding
armored
bears.
Volibear
is
possibly
inspired
from
the
armored
bears
(most
prominently
Iorek
Byrnison)
that
appear
through
out
Philip
Pullman's
trilogy,
known
as
Panserbjørne
(lit.
'armored
bears',
Danish/Norwegian
origin).
Atlantica's
Druid
Mercenary,
,
also
seems
to
be
related.
When
there
is
an
enemy
present
in
game,
Volibear
will
gain
the
icon
with
the
text:
"Not
even
could
keep
an
armored
bear
out
of
the
League
of
Legends".

A
side-by-side
comparison

be
seen

name
"Thunder
Lord"

Northern
Storm

Volibear's
skill
Rolling
Thunder
is
the
same
name
as
Henry
Fillmore's
famous
band
piece,
Rolling
Thunder,
featuring
the
low
brass.
Volibear
has
special
quotes
when
slaying
.
Whenever
Volibear
slays
Zilean,
he
will
remark:
"
or
"
Volibear's
quote
"A
fool
and
his
head
are
easily
parted."
Is
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
"A
fool
and
his
head
are
soon
parted.",
which
was
first
used
in
the
1984
novel
"The
Final
Reflection".
It
is
also
a
reference
to
"A
fool
and
his
money
are
easily
parted"
is
a
likely
a
reference
to
the
,
a
major
military
organization
created
during
the

is
a
more
direct
reference
to
,
the
king
of
the
Panserbjørne
from
the
trilogy.
Volibear
forged
an
alliance
with
to
battle
the
coming
.
Due
to
the
fact
that
the
Riot
design
director,
Zileas,
was
adamantly
against
the
implementation
of
armored
bears,
Volibear
and
dislike
each
other.
In
addition
to
that,
Zilean's
fatalistic
attitude
towards
the
end
of
things
vs
Volibear's
defiance
against
Lissandra
and
the
Watchers
serves
another
legitimate
reason.
