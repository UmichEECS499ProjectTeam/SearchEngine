Malcolm
Graves
was
born
in
the
back
of
a
tavern
and
left
there
with
a
bottle
of
spiked
milk.
He
survived
a
childhood
in
the
pirate-run
slums
using
every
dirty
trick
in
the
book.
Intent
on
building
a
new
life
for
himself,
he
stowed
away
on
the
first
ship
to
the
mainland
he
could
sneak
aboard.
However,
the
grim
realities
of
the
world
forced
him
to
eke
out
an
unsavory
living
in
the
underground
of
various
city-states,
jumping
the
border
whenever
things
got
too
hot.
At
a
particularly
high-stakes
game
of
cards,
he
found
himself
seated
opposite
.
They
both
flipped
four
aces
on
the
final
hand.
It
was
the
first
time
either
conman
had
met
his
equal.
The
two
formed
an
alliance,
swindling
marks
at
the
tables
and
scrapping
back-to-back
in
the
alleys
afterward.
Together,
they
ran
the
streets
–
stacking
chips,
decks,
and
rap
sheets.
Unfortunately
Graves
made
the
mistake
of
hustling
a
hefty
sum
from
Dr.
Aregor
Priggs,
a
high-ranking
official
and
businessman.
When
Priggs
discovered
how
he'd
been
played,
he
became
obsessed
with
revenge.
He
learned
about
Twisted
Fate's
all-consuming
desire
to
control
magic
and
he
promptly
offered
him
a
trade:
serve
Graves
up
in
exchange
for
enrollment
in
a
procedure
which
would
grant
his
wish.
Twisted
Fate
took
the
deal
–
both
he
and
Graves
knew
the
stakes
of
their
arrangement,
but
the
offer
was
too
good.
Once
acquired,
Priggs
had
Graves
taken
to
a
special
location
built
to
hold
men
whose
crimes
–
or
more
precisely
their
punishments
–
were
meant
to
stay
off
the
books.
Graves
endured
years
of
captivity
at
the
hands
of
Zaun's
wardens
before
he
managed
to
escape.
One
of
his
fellow
detainees
introduced
him
to
an
eccentric
gunsmith
who
modified
a
shotgun
exactly
to
his
specifications.
He
named
it
"Destiny."
After
he
paid
a
visit
to
Priggs,
Graves
joined
with
two
targets
in
his
sights:
Twisted
Fate
and
payback.

If
you've
ever
had
a
nemesis
in
your
life
that
made
you
want
to
call
him
out
for
a
showdown
like
the
no-good,
low-down,
varmint,
snake-in-the-grass
that
he
is,
you'll
probably
have
a
bit
in
common
with
this
next
champion.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Graves,
the
Outlaw.
In
addition
to
being
one
of
those
crack-shot
renegade
types,
Graves
is
possessed
of
a
particular
disinclination
towards
everyone's
favorite
Southern
gentleman,
.
Whatever
the
result
of
his
arrival
in
the
League,
one
thing’s
for
certain:
Somebody's
going
to
go
out
with
a
bang!
Greetings
Summoners!
We
wanted
to
take
this
opportunity
to
preview
some
of
the
gameplay
on
our
newest
ranged
DPS
champion:
Graves,
the
Outlaw.
This
rough-and-tumble
gunman
uses
a
massive,
hextech
double-barreled
shotgun
to
rain
down
death
from
a
distance
and
punish
any
foolish
varmints
that
get
too
close.
For
example,
Buckshot
shoots
three
quick
shrapnel
bursts
in
a
cone
in
front
of
him.
Unlike
other
multi-missile
spells,
however,
all
three
Buckshot
rounds
can
all
hit
the
same
target
(although
each
individual
projectile
will
deal
slightly
reduced
damage).
Graves
is
also
able
to
make
it
uncomfortable
for
foes
to
fight
at
his
optimal
range
by
throwing
out
Smoke
Screen
to
limit
enemy
vision
and
slow
them
in
an
area,
while
Quick
Draw
lets
him
dash
in
for
a
quick
shotgun
blast
or
escape
danger
as
needed.
In
this
way
he
can
control
his
positioning
to
set
up
maximum
damage
Buckshots.
Finally,
Graves
can
use
Collateral
Damage
to
unleash
a
skill
shot
that
nukes
the
first
target
it
hits,
spreading
a
cone
of
damage
behind
its
target
to
hit
anybody
yellow
enough
to
hide
behind
the
tanks.
While
the
single-target
use
is
simple,
properly
utilizing
the
cone
is
what
will
separate
the
good
Graves
players
from
the
great
ones.
Our
goal
with
Graves
was
to
make
a
ranged
DPS
that
had
some
incentive
to
get
up
close
or
make
enemies
think
twice
before
getting
in
your
face.
While
it's
completely
possible
to
play
Graves
as
a
standard
max-range
carry,
this
dichotomy
makes
for
skill
differential
without
adding
a
high
barrier
to
entry
(or
any
hefty,
paragraph-long
tooltips).
Whether
trying
to
maximize
the
close-up
damage
of
Buckshot,
or
setting
up
the
1-2
punch
of
Collateral
Damage,
we’re
excited
to
add
a
champion
with
true
grit
to
the
ranged
DPS
lineup.
Summoners!
If
it
ever
crossed
your
mind
that
your
favorite
shotgun-slinging
Outlaw
could
benefit
from
a
touch
of
Roaring
20’s
charm,
you’re
sure
to
be
excited
for
Mafia
Graves.
Featuring
the
latest
in
prohibitionary
fashion,
we
guarantee
that
you’ll
find
no
better
excuse
to
make
your
teammates
call
you
“godfather.”
So
dust
off
your
fedora,
polish
up
your
Thompson
and
load
up
a
fresh
batch
of
moonshine,
because
Mafia
Graves
is
here
to
make
you
an
offer
you
can’t
refuse.
Never
go
against
the
family,
summoners!
Both
Arcade
Sona
and
Riot
Graves
will
be
given
to
PAX
attendees.
If
you
can’t
make
it
to
the
show,
these
skins
will
be
on
sale
in
the
League
of
Legends
store
August
31
through
September
2.
Arcade
Sona
will
remain
in
the
store
after
PAX
ends,
but
Riot
Graves
will
be
going
back
into
the
Vault
until
another
Riot
event.
