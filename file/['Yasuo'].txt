Yasuo
the
Unforgiven
or
Release
date
Yasuo's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them
and
their
use
is
limited
only
by
cooldowns.
His
secondary
resource
bar
tracks
his
unique
mechanic:
Flow.
Yasuo
can
have
up
to
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
Flow.
Yasuo
generates
1%
of
his
maximum
Flow
with
every
46
units
he
travels,
requiring
a
total
of
to
obtain
maximum
Flow.
Flow
does
not
decay
or
generate
idly.
As
Flow
generation
is
based
on
distance
travelled,
it
is
also
accumulated
while
dashing,
teleporting
or
when
displaced
by
crowd
control
effects.
Yasuo's
critical
strike
chance
is
doubled,
but
the
damage
dealt
by
his
critical
strikes
is
reduced
by
10%
(25%
on
Steel
Tempest).
At
maximum
Flow,
the
next
time
Yasuo
would
take
damage
from
a
champion
or
monster
he
first
converts
his
Flow
into
a
shield
that
absorbs
damage.
After
1.5
seconds,
if
not
already
depleted,
Yasuo
loses
all
his
Flow.
Additional
Information:
Consecutive
successful
casts
of
Steel
Tempest
within
10
seconds
form
a
chain.
Steel
Tempest
can
critically
strike,
having
a
25%
damage
penalty.
Without
any
additional
critical
damage
the
bonus
damage
equals
.
Additionally,
on-hit
effects
will
be
applied
to
the
first
enemy
hit
within
475-unit
range.
The
cooldown
and
cast
time
of
Steel
Tempest
is
reduced
based
on
Yasuo's
bonus
attack
speed
and
unaffected
by
cooldown
reduction.
Additional
Information:
Yasuo
generates
a
percentage
of
his
maximum
Flow
whenever
he
uses
in
addition
to
the
amount
that
is
generated
for
the
distance
moved.
Yasuo
creates
a
gust
of
wind
that
travels
forward
to
form
a
wall
400
units
away
from
himself.
The
wall
slowly
drifts
forward
over
3.
seconds,
blocking
all
enemy
projectiles
with
the
exception
of
tower
hits.

Yasuo
dashes
475
units
in
the
direction
of
the
target
enemy,
dealing
magic
damage
and
marking
them
briefly.
The
speed
of
the
dash
scales
with
Yasuo's
bonus
movement
speed.
Each
cast
increases
the
next
dash's
base
damage
by
25%
for
5
seconds,
up
to
100%
bonus
damage.
Yasuo
cannot
use
Sweeping
Blade
on
an
enemy
that's
already
been
marked.
Additional
Information:
Yasuo
blinks
to
the
nearest
visible
airborne
enemy
champion
to
the
cursor,
instantly
generating
maximum
Flow.
Upon
arriving,
he
suspends
all
airborne
units
within
a
400-radius
of
his
target
in
the
air
for
1
second
while
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
of
them.
Once
he
lands,
Yasuo
gains
50%
penetration
to
armor
for
15
seconds.

Last
Breath
will
reset
the
chain
on
