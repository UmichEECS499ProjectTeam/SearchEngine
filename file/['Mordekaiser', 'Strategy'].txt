Mordekaiser
can
make
excellent
use
of
his
shield
at
all
stages
of
the
game,
from
absorbing
harassment
to
giving
powerful
survivability
during
team
fights,
letting
him
stay
in
the
field
longer
than
most
other
champions.
However,
keep
in
mind
that
spamming
skills
will
result
in
consistently
low

Mordekaiser's
large
array
of
damaging
AoE
abilities
lends
him
to
be
a
formidable
teamfighter.
His
shield
is
a
powerful
asset,
letting
him
remain
in
combat
for
extended
periods
as
long
as
he
makes
constant
use
of
his
abilities.
Mordekaiser's
abilities
offer
different
quirks
depending
on
which
is
prioritized
for
leveling.
Like
most
other
secondary
units,
the
soul
you've
stolen
with
can
be
controlled
using
Alt
+
Right
Click.
However,
unlike
most
secondary
units,
your
ghost
acts
as
an
allied
champion,
and
will
be
affected
by
abilities
that
can
only
target
champions,
such
as

and

Try
and
wait
until
your
target
is
fairly
low

before
casting

as
most
people
will
run
when
they
see
they
have

on
them.
The
combination
of

is
deadly
to
almost
any
wounded
enemy.
ghost
will
attract
tower
aggro
first,
but
if
it
attacks
a
champion
while
you
are
in
range,
you
will
become
the
new
target.
If
you
cast
on
the
ghost
and
it
hurts
an
enemy
champion,
you
will
draw
aggro
instead
of
the
ghost.
Be
wary
of
this
when
attempting
to
tower
dive
weakened
enemies.
The
same
virtues
that
let
teamfight
effectively
also
lets
him
farm
and
push
extremely
quickly.
Take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
many
people
underestimate
Mordekaiser's
damage
once
he
gets
his
ultimate.
When
combined
with
and
his
other
abilities,
he
can
burst
down
and
enslave
enemies
who
get
in
range
of
him
deceptively
easily.
Mordekaiser
is
a
powerful
duelist,
due
to
his
,
the
natural
spell
vamp
from
,
the
bonus
armor
and
constant
damage
from
and
the
greatly
increased
damage
on

In
choosing
your
target
for
Children
of
the
Grave,
consider
if
you'd
rather
kill
off
an
AP
based
champ
and
use
that
champion's
stats
to
make
yourself
stronger
or
if
you'd
rather
kill
the
enemy
AD
carry
in
order
to
kill
the
enemies
that
way,
in
both
cases
you
gain
a
substantial
stat
boost
that
can
make
a
difference
in
a
big
fight.
Early
purchases

items
