of
Luminosity
or
Release
date
Lux's
damaging
spells
mark
any
enemies
with
light
energy
for
6
seconds.
Her
autoattacks
or
will
consume
the
mark,
dealing

(10

magic
damage
to
the
target.
Additional
Information:
Lux
releases
a
sphere
of
light
in
a
line,
striking
up
to
two
enemy
units
along
its
path.
It
deals
magic
damage
to
the
first
enemy
it
touches
and
half
that
damage
to
a
second
enemy
behind
it.
Additionally,
the
first
enemy
struck
is
rooted
for
2
seconds,
and
the
second
enemy
is
rooted
for
1
second.
Additional
Information:
Lux
shields
herself
for
up
to
3
seconds
and
throws
out
her
wand
in
a
line,
applying
the
same
shield
to
allied
champions
in
its
path.
Her
wand
then
returns
to
her,
again
shielding
allied
champions
in
its
path
and
Lux
herself
upon
return.
When
reapplied,
the
shield
does
not
stack,
but
is
refreshed.
Additional
Information:
Lux
sends
an
anomaly
of
twisted
light
to
a
target
area,
slowing
enemies
within
300
range
and
granting
sight
of
a
slightly
larger
area
for
up
to
5
seconds.
At
the
end
of
the
duration
or
if
is
activated
again,
the
zone
will
detonate
and
deal
magic
damage
to
enemies
in
the
area.
Additional
Information:
After
gathering
energy
for
half
a
second,
Lux
fires
a
broad
and
long-range
beam
of
light
in
a
line
that
deals
magic
damage
to
all
enemies
in
the
area.
Any
enemies
that
are
already
marked
by
have
it
ignited
for
