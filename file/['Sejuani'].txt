Wrath
or

date
Damaging
an

/
/
/
bonus
armor
and
reduces
movement-slowing
effects
on
Sejuani
by
/
/
/
%
for

further
damage
refreshing
the
duration.
Additional
Information:
Sejuani
charges
forward,
knocking
enemies
into
the
air
and
dealing
magic
damage
equal
to
a
flat
amount
plus
a
percentage
of
their
maximum
health
(max
300
damage
to
monsters).
This
charge
stops
after
knocking
an
enemy
champion
into
the
air.
Additional
Information:
Sejuani's
next
basic
attack
deals
bonus
magic
damage
to
the
target
and
enemies
near
it.
She
then
swings
her
flail,
dealing
magic
damage
each
second
to
enemies
within
range
for
4
seconds.
If
this
ability
is
reactivated,
Sejuani
immediately
starts
swinging
her
flail.
Additional
Information:
Sejuani's
abilities
and
basic
attacks
apply
Frost
to
enemies
for
4
seconds.
All
nearby
enemies
with
Frost
take
magic
damage
and
are
slowed,
and
the
Frost
debuff
is
removed
from
the
targets
of
Permafrost.
This
spell
is
unable
to
be
cast
if
no
enemies
in
range
have
the
Frost
debuff.
Additional
Information:
Sejuani
throws
her
frost-forged
bola
in
a
line.
If
the
bola
hits
an
enemy
champion,
it
shatters,
stunning
the
target
and
nearby
enemies
for
a
duration.
If
the
bola
reaches
its
maximum
range,
it
shatters
and
slows
enemies
by
90%
instead
for
the
same
duration.
All
enemies
in
the
shatter
area
take
magic
damage.
