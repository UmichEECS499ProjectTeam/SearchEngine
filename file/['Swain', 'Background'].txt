The
earliest
account
of
Swain's
existence
comes
from
a
infirmary
doctor's
notes.
According
to
them,
Swain
limped
into
the
ward
without
cry
or
complaint:
his
right
leg
was
snapped
in
half,
with
bone
protruding
from
the
skin.
A
small,
scowling
bird
seemed
affixed
to
his
shoulder.
The
doctor
gawked
in
horror
as
the
young
adolescent
answered
questions
about
his
health
and
age
with
a
calm,
even
stare.
Even
behind
the
echoing
crack
as
the
sand
counterweights
reset
his
tibia,
Swain’s
measuring
gaze
never
flickered,
nor
did
his
eyes
twitch
from
the
pop
of
his
fibula.
He
refused
the
doctor’s
recommendation
of
magical
treatment
for
the
leg’s
inoperable
damage,
requesting
only
a
spare
crutch
before
shuffling
away.
He
next
surfaced
in
documents
from
the
Noxian
military,
although
it
is
evident
that
they
are
incomplete.
Normally
a
crippled
boy
would
be
turned
away
in
shame
from
Noxus’
proud
legion,
but
the
records
indicate
his
first
designation
was
that
of
a
ranking
officer.
The
men
who've
served
under
him
(and
survived)
have
remained
in
his
charge
with
unshakable
faith
and
loyalty.
He
leapt
through
the
High
Command's
hierarchy,
often
ascending
when
superiors
requested
demotions
to
join
his
unit.
A
cunning
strategist,
Swain
was
decorated
after
every
battle
he
fought,
regularly
hobbling
in
contemplation
at
the
front
of
the
assault.
His
rise
to
power
seemed
unceasing
until
he
was
suddenly
relegated
to
inactive
status
prior
to
the
Invasion
-
a
bewildering
decision
which
reeked
of
bureaucratic
subversion.
If
Swain
was
upset
by
the
events
which
unfolded,
he
never
believed
it.
His
face
was
so
implacable
that
it
was
popularly
rumored
to
be
a
mask,
disguising
something
utterly
inhuman
beneath.
More
controversy
surrounded
the
bird
that
never
left
his
shoulder,
whose
name
he
whispered
only
to
it.
When
escalated
its
presence
in
,
Swain
was
immediately
returned
to
active
duty.
defeated
Keiran
Darkwill
in
a
duel
contesting
the
leadership
of
last
night,
winning
the
support
of
High
Command.
Despite
rumors
of
involvement
with
the
scandal
in
,
Swain
has
been
named
Grand
General
–
the
highest
position
in
Noxus.
The
gathered
members
of
High
Command
unanimously
agreed
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
Master
Tactician.
With
none
remaining
to
protest
his
claim,
High
Command
named
Jericho
Swain
the
Grand
General
of
Noxus.
While
High
Command
has
embraced
his
rule,
Swain’s
leadership
remains
controversial
in
Noxus's
lower
houses.
Some
accuse
Swain
of
willing
participation
in
Heywan
Relivash’s
scheme
to
obtain
Kalamanda.
Noxian

Kalamanda
High
Command
remained
divided
in
support
between
the
two
men
since
Swain
returned
earlier
this
month.
Keiran
Darkwill
challenged
Swain
to
a
duel
to
settle
the
dispute,
claiming
that
such
a
standstill
was
a
"coward’s
game."
Many
members
of
High
Command
believed
this
to
be
a
strong
move
and
expected
Keiran,
a
notoriously
skilled
duelist,
to
win.
Keiran
initially
had
the
upper
hand
but
due
to
Swain's
magical
tactics,
Keiran
surprisingly
lost.
