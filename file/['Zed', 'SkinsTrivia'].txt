Zed's
ultimate
was
changed
before
release
to
create
only
one
shadow.
It
originally
created
two
shadows
and
is
still
animated
for
two.
Zed
was
designed
by
and
.
Zed
is
the
1st
champion
whose
shows
him
escaping
(via
a
shadow
portal),
rather
than
actually
dying.
Whether
he
actually
manages
to
cheat
death
remains
open
to
debate.
Zed
is
the
5th
champion
to
utilize
energy
as
a
resource.
Zed
is
one
of
the
8
champions
who
do
not
have
a
single
skill
that
scales
off
ability

Zed's
abilities
have
elements
that
mirror
those
of
the
Kinkou's.
Zed's
Razor
Shuriken
mirrors
Kennen's
Thundering
Shuriken,
his
Living
Shadow
mirrors
Shen's
Shadow
Dash
and
his
Shadow
Slash
mirrors
Akali's
Crescent
Slash.
Zed's
ultimate
Death
Mark
also
"marks"
a
target,
which
deals
additional
effects
upon
detonation.
This
is
similar
to
Shen's
Vorpal
Blades,
Kennen's
Mark
of
the
Storm
and
Akali's
Mark
of
the
Assassin.
Zed's
joke
is
a
reference
to
the
franchise.
Zed
shares
a
quote
with
:
Zed
has
a
special
taunt
when
facing
Shen
Zed
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
from
the
franchise,
namely
Shredder's
later
designs
where
his
face
cannot
be
seen
and
his
facemask
is
a
grill-like
kenpo.
Zed
has
similar
powers
over
shadows
and
looks
similar
to
from
the
series.
Zed
also
bears
some
resemblance
to
from
the
franchise,
mainly
due
to
the
name
and
similarities
in
the
mask.
Zed's
Shockblade
skin
bears
some
resemblance
to
from
the
franchise.
Zed's
dance
is
inspired
by
various
martial
arts.
The
animator
that
formed
the
idea
is
a
black
belt.
Zed's
name
is
similar
to
the
name
of
the
antagonist
organization
from
the
classic
series,
where
the
organization
is
known
as
"Zeed"
and
later
"Neo
Zeed".
Furthermore,
in
the
game
"Revenge
of
Shinobi",
Neo
Zeed
kills
the
protagonist's
master.
Additionally
the
final
boss
of
Shinobi
3
is
called
the
,
and
has
a
very
similar
design
to
Zed.
Zed
and
were
taught
under
the
same
master,
Shen's
father,
and
were
rivals
to
one
another.
However,
before
Zed's
fall,
Shen
respected
him
as
a
strong
fellow
student
and
was
even
a
bit
jealous
of
him
as
Shen's
father
was
less
strict
towards
him.
Zed
seeks
to
abolish
the
old
ways
of
balance
and
replace
them
with
the
forbidden
art
of
the
shadow.
Any
ninja
who
refuses
to
learn
will
be
eliminated.
According
to
Runaan,
may
have
some
former
connection
to
Zed.
What
that
connection
was
has
yet
to
be
elaborated
on,
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
her
title,
"the
Fist
of
",
and
her
passive,
"Twin
Disciples".
In
a
later
post,

mentions
that
Zed
once
has
a

who
has
