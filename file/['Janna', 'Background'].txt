you
thought
it

just
a
harmless
breeze!"
"Yes,
it's
true.
For
only
$2.95
a
minute,
I
will
leave
you
breathless."
"Say
hello
to
the
winds
of...*double

throat*
I

in
tornado
alley!"
"Heavy
winds
approaching!"
"Hold
on
to
your
hats!"
"They're
in
for
the
storm
of
the
century!"
"Death
counts
rising
into
the
double
digits
tonight!"
"Perfect
weather
for
a
teamfight."

risk
of
severe
thunderstorm."
"We're
seeing
a
distinct
chance
of
pentakills!"
"Pain
front
rolling
in!"

didn't
spend
five
years
studying
journalism
for
this."
"Bringing

weather."
"Expect
sporadic
ganks."
"Stay
indoors
today."
"I
get
the
worst
assignments..."
"Mic
check!
Am
I
coming
in?"
"We're
looking
on
a
one
hundred
percent
chance
of
carnage!"
"Let's
take
a
look
at
the
minimap."
"I'm
gonna
need
a
new
umbrella."
"We're

a
spawn
of
every
6
minutes
today."

my
winds
-
and
the
teleprompter
-
guide
you!"

up
wards
for
low
visibility
locations."
"Five
day
forecast:
sunshine,
rainbows
and
bloodshed!"
"And
this
harass
is
gonna
continue
on
into
the
evening!"
"It
looks
like
there's
a
low
chance
any
skillshots
are
gonna
hit
us!"
"Surrender
is
likely
with
high
pressure
systems
all
over
the
map."
"We
may
see
a
couple
of
clouds
but
nothing
to
worry
abou-
ahhh!"
"A
little
bit
of
precipitation
is
nothing
to
have
a
bad
hair-
urgh!"

you've
got
nothing
to
fe-
agh!"

be
right
back
after
a
word
from
our
summoning
platform!"
"And
back
to
you,
shopkeeper!"'
"Likelihood
of
acid
rain
nearing
one-hundred
percent!"
"Unknown
weather
pattern!"
"Scary
clouds!"
"We're
going
to
edit
that
out,
right?"
"Janna
signing
off...!"
"Back
to
you...!"
"This
is
shaping
up
to
be
a
scorcher!"
"Things
are
really
heating
up
here."
"I'm
live
at
the
scene
and
it's
just...
cats
and
dogs
here."
