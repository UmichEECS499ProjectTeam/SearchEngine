Ziggs
was
born
with
a
talent
for
tinkering,
but
his
chaotic,
hyperactive
nature
was
unusual
among
scientists.
Aspiring
to
be
a
revered
inventor
like
,
he
rattled
through
ambitious
projects
with
manic
zeal,
emboldened
by
both
his
explosive
failures
and
his
unprecedented
discoveries.
Word
of
Ziggs'
volatile
experimentation
reached
the
famed
Yordle
Academy
in
and
its
esteemed
professors
invited
him
to
demonstrate
his
craft.
His
characteristic
disregard
for
safety
brought
the
presentation
to
an
early
conclusion,
however,
when
the
hextech
engine
Ziggs
was
demonstrating
overheated
and
exploded,
blowing
a
huge
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
Academy.
The
professors
dusted
themselves
off
and
sternly
motioned
for
him
to
leave.
Devastated,
Ziggs
prepared
to
return
to
in
shame.
However,
before
he
could
leave,
a
group
of
agents
infiltrated
the
Academy
and
kidnapped
the
professors.
The
Piltover
military
tracked
the
captives
to
a
Zaunite
prison,
but
their
weapons
were
incapable
of
destroying
the
fortified
walls.
Determined
to
outdo
them,
Ziggs
began
experimenting
on
a
new
kind
of
armament,
and
quickly
realized
that
he
could
harness
his
accidental
gift
for
demolition
to
save
the
captured
yordles.
Before
long,
Ziggs
had
created
a
line
of
powerful
bombs
he
lovingly
dubbed
"hexplosives."
With
his
new
creations
ready
for
their
first
trial,
Ziggs
traveled
to
and
snuck
into
the
prison
compound.
He
launched
a
gigantic
bomb
at
the
prison
and
watched
with
glee
as
the
explosion
tore
through
the
reinforced
wall.
Once
the
smoke
had
cleared,
Ziggs
scuttled
into
the
facility,
sending
guards
running
with
a
hail
of
bombs.
He
rushed
to
the
cell,
blew
the
door
off
its
hinges,
and
led
the
captive
yordles
to
freedom.
Upon
returning
to
the
Academy,
the
humbled
professors
recognized
Ziggs
with
an
honorary
title
-
Dean
of
Demolitions
-
and
proposed
that
he
demonstrate
this
new
form
of
yordle
ingenuity
in
.
Vindicated
at
last,
Ziggs
accepted
the
proposal,
eager
to
bring
his
ever-expanding
range
of
hexplosives
to
the
greatest
testing
grounds
in
the
world:
the
.
In
addition
to
the
above
quotes,
Ziggs
makes
several
laughing
noises
as
he
moves
about
and
attacks
on
a
regular
basis,
with
no
determinate
script
or
occasion
as
to
when
he
does
so.
This
is
unique
to
other
champions,
whom
only
play
audible
sounds
on
action
by
the
player.

When
you’ve
got
to
cool
down
from
a
long
day
at
the
hexsplosives
factory,
take
a
dip
into
the
deep
end
with
Pool
Party
Ziggs.
This
weekend
warrior’s
got
everything
he
needs
for
a
fun-filled
day
of
summer
sun
and
massive
damage.
Ziggs
sports
all
the
necessary
pool
equipment:
an
inflatable
ducky
inner
tube,
goggles,
a
bathing
cap,
snorkel,
and
flipper
fins.
The
real
danger,
however,
lies
in
Ziggs’
arsenal
of
drench-worthy
water
bombs
that
replace
his
trusty
hexsplosives,
annihilating
enemies
with
a
pop-and-a-splash.
Everyone
out
of
the
pool
–
it’s
yordle
swim
only
when
Pool
Party
Ziggs
has
his
way.

"Ziggs?
Unpredictable,

yes
yes.
But

"This'll

"Bombs
away!"
"Fuses

"Take

"Fire

"Explosion

"It's

"Right-o."
"Anyone
got

"Come

come

come

"Let's
blow

"Hey,
where'd
that

go?"
"Don't
worry,
I
got
this."
"What
do
you
mean
this
doesn't
look
safe?"
"Impatient?
I'm
not
impatient."
"I'm
going,
I'm
going."
"I'll
take
this
one
and
this
one
and
throw
it
in
your
face!"
"I
like
my
enemies
like
I
like
my
bombs:
about
to
explode."
"Come
on!
Does
this
look
dangerous
to
you?"
"You
wanna

how
to
disarm
a
bomb?"

"Yeee-Haaa!"

"Oh!

Many
of
you
have
noticed
that
it’s
been
a
while
since
the
last
yordle
joined
the
League
of
Legends.
Since
we’re
aware
that
yordle
enthusiasts
can
have
something
of
a
short
fuse,
we
wanted
to
assure
you
that
we
have
another
of
these
pint-sized
heroes
coming
your
way.
So
just
to
clarify,
there’s
absolutely
no
reason
to
get
batty,
bonkers,
manic,
mental,
out
of
hand
or
in
any
other
way
out
of
control.
As
an
example,
we
might
start
to
get
a
little
worried
about
you
if
we
caught
you
scribbling
down
something
like
this:
Dubious
schematics
are
a
clear
warning
sign
of
madcap
machinations,
and
we’ll
have
none
of
that
here
in
the
League
of
Legends!
Naturally,
mysterious,
bomb-like
blueprints
like
these
are
no
laughing
matter
outside
the
hands
of
a
trained
professional.
Trained,
furry,
little
hands
like
those
belonging
to
Ziggs,
the
Hexplosives
Expert.
This
turbulent
technician
with
a
propensity
for
pyrotechnics
should
satisfy
all
your
yordle
wants
and
needs!
The
enormous
talent
of
the
League
of
Legends
community
shines
through
in
all
of
the
awesome
fan
creations,
songs,
and
art
that
you
send
us
every
day.
Sometimes,
a
community
member
puts
forth
an
idea
that
excites
players
and
inspires
a
reality.
In
MaTTcom’s
case,
it
was
two
fully-realized
skin
splash
arts
that
got
the
community
jazzed
-
Pool
Party
Ziggs
and
AstroNautilus.
These
two
skins
are
indicative
of
the
power
and
creativity
of
our
community
and
now
they’re
ready
for
some
end-of-summer
fun.
