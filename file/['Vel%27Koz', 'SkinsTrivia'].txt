Vel'Koz's
lore
is
the
first
to
be
told
in
first-person.
The
in
Vel'Koz
came
from
one
of
his
names
during
development,
The
Keeper
of
Secrets.
The

could
be
attributed
to
the
word
"Velocity",
a
standard
measurement
of
an
objects
speed
(perhaps
a
reference
to
his
victims
fleeing
on
sight
of
him).
Vel'Koz's
mission
is
to
learn
about
Valoran.
Unfortunately,
Vel'Koz's
means
of
investigation
involves
disintegration
—requiring
him
to
first
decide
if
a
subject
is
worth
destroying

Vel'Koz
was
speculated
to
be
in

way,
related
to

who
were
referred
to
in

lore.
Speculation
about
this
relationship
first
arose
due
to
visual
similarities
between
Vel'Koz
and
the
many
statues
that
can
be
found
in
the
,
as
well
as
the
symbol
of
the
Frostguard;

direct
interpretation

quote:
However,
in
the
Vel'Koz
AMA
on
Reddit,
the
developers
said
that
Vel'Koz
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
Watchers,
however

has
been
hinted
that
a
void
portal
in
Freljord
is
posible.

and
possibly
intentionally,
Vel'Koz
was
revealed
on

an
international
event
held
in
protest
of
surveillance.
Each

Vel'Koz's
eyes

theme.
Vel'Koz's
original
voice
script
was
intended
to
have
more
humor,
with
Vel'Koz
in
on
his
own
joke.
However,
it
was
decided
that
"amoral
and
heartless"
was
a
better
theme
and
his
script
was
made
to
sound
more
creepy.
