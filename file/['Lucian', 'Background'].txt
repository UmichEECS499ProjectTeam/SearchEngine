Lucian
wields
relic
weapons
imbued
with
ancient
power
and
stands
a
stalwart
guardian
against
the
undead.
His
cold
conviction
never
wavers,
even
in
the
face
of
the
maddening
horrors
he
destroys
beneath
his
hail
of
purifying
fire.
Lucian
walks
alone
on
a
grim
mission:
to
purge
the
spirits
of
those
ensnared
in
undeath,
his
eternal
beloved
among
them.
Like
the
twin
relic
weapons
they
wielded,
Lucian
and
his
wife
Senna
were
carved
from
the
same
stone.
Together
they
battled
evil
in
for
years,
bringing
light
to
darkness
and
purging
those
taken
by
corruption.
They
were
beacons
of
righteousness:
Senna's
dedication
to
their
cause
never
faltered,
while
Lucian's
kindness
and
warmth
touched
the
hearts
of
the
many
lives
they
saved.
Two
parts
of
one
whole,
they
were
devoted
and
inseparable.
Though
Lucian
and
Senna
witnessed
terror
that
would
break
most
warriors,
nothing
they
had
seen
compared
to
the
horrors
wrought
by
the
.
When
the
spectral
denizens
of
that
accursed
place
began
to
manifest
across
Runeterra,
Lucian
and
Senna
hunted
them
down
wherever
they
appeared.
It
was
grim
work,
but
the
fearless
pair
prevailed
until
one
tragic
encounter
with
the
soul-collector
.
Lucian
and
Senna
had
faced
such
nightmarish
undead
before,
but
never
one
so
deviously
clever
and
cruel.
As
the
terrible
battle
unfolded,
Thresh
sprung
an
unexpected
ploy.
To
Lucian's
horror,
the
creature
tricked
Senna
and
ensnared
her
soul,
trapping
her
in
a
spectral
prison.
Nothing
could
bring
her
back.
Senna
was
lost,
and
for
the
first
time,
Lucian
faced
his
mission
alone.
Though
the
Warden
had
taken
half
of
Lucian's
heart,
he
had
also
created
the
Shadow
Isles'
most
dangerous
foe.
Lucian
became
a
man
of
dark
determination,
one
who
would
stop
at
nothing
to
purge
the
undead
from
the
face
of
Runeterra.
In
honor
of
Senna's
memory,
he
took
up
her
fallen
weapon
and
vowed
to
see
their
mission
through
to
the
end.
Now
wielding
both
relic
weapons,
Lucian
fights
to
slay
the
undead
and
cleanse
the
souls
of
the
Shadow
Isles.
He
knows
that
Senna's
soul
is
lost,
but
never
loses
hope
that
one
day
he
will
bring
her
peace.

Runeterra
Shadow
Isles
"Be
grateful.
By
slaying
you
now,
I
spare
you
an
eternity
of
torment."
―
"She
was
everything
to
me...
but
took
her,
and
with
her,
they
took
my
kindness,
and
my
mercy.
That
was
their
mistake,
because
now,
all
I've
got
left
is
a
cold
heart.
They
thrive
on
doubt.
They
feast
on
fear.
These
wretched
abominations
blight
this
world,
and
every
last
one
of
them
will
perish
by
my
hand."
―
"Everybody
dies.
Some
just
need
a
little
help."
"Rest
in
peace."
"They
never
get
tired
of
dying."
"Bullseyes."
"Stay
dead."
"Purity
and
peace."
"By
all
means,
stand
and
fight."
"This
mercy."
"We're
gonna
need
more
coffins."
"Just
another
corpse."
"Tough
talk
for
worm
food."
"Don't
duck
on
my
account."
"Trick
shot?
The
trick
is
to
get
shot."
"Rise
again,
I
dare
you."
"H'yeah,
I've
got
a
cure
for
that."
"Keep
moving
on."
"Everybody
deserves
a
second
shot."
"Death
should
be
the
end."
"There's
a
chill
in
the
air."
"Nothing
colder
than
death."
"I'll
sleep
when
they're
dead."
"The
past
is
just
a
ghost."
"Something
is
rotten
here."
"Go
ahead,
scare
me."
"You
don't
have
the
heart
for
this."
"Don't
look
so
grim."
"Some
call
it
magic.
I
call
it
good
aim."
"Smile?
Alright."
"This
my
happy
face.
See?"
"Heheh,
and
they
say
I
have
a
grim
sense
of
humor."
"No,
really...
I
smilin'."
"I'll
have
no
trouble
killing
you,
and
less
trouble
killing
you
again!"
"Death
is
a
mercy,
and
I
have
enough
mercy
to
go
around."
"Death
at
the
door?
Hmph,
no.
I
am
the
one
who
knocks."
"You
took
the
better
half
of
me,
Thresh.
What
you
left
is
a
dangerous
enemy."
"It's
not
that
I
fear
you,
Hecarim.
I
just
hate
to
put
a
good
horse
down."
"Let's
crack
you
open,
Mordekaiser,
and
see
what's
inside."
Lucian
laughs.
Lucian
laughs.
Lucian
laughs.
Lucian
laughs.
"It
ends
here!"
"For
Senna!"
"Ashes
and
dust!"
"This
is
over!"
"Senna..."
"I
failed..."
Lucian

"When
we
took
up
these
weapons,
we
accepted
our
mission
with
pride.
Rid
Runeterra
of
evil,
they
told
us.
Slay
the
corrupt.
Send
the
filth
of
the
world
crawling
back
to
the
hole
it
crawled
out
of.
Not
just
anyone
can
wield
these
weapons.
You
need
a
pure
heart.
A
fearless
mind.
An
inner
light
that
outshines
all
the
darkness
in
the
world.
Once
I
had
that
light.
Now
I'm
not
so
sure.
Everything
changed.
We
knew
our
mission
was
greater
than
ourselves.
The
enemy
was
not
who
we
fought,
but
what
we
fought.
Evil.
The
Shadow
Isles?
Just
another
mess
to
clean
up,
just
a
bunch
of
ghosts.
They
were
abominations,
but
nothing
we
hadn't
put
in
the
ground
before.
Until
the
day
we
faced
him.
Until
the
day
he
ripped
her
from
my
life."
"Now
my
enemy
has
a
name.
She
wouldn't
want
me
to
come
after
her--she
knew
the
risks.
But
I
can't
forget
her.
I
won't
forget
her.
I'll
hunt
down
the
bastard
who
took
her
from
me
and
send
him
straight
to
the
grave.
Twice,
if
I
have
to."
