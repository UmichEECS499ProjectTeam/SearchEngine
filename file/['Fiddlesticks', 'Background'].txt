Those
who
say
'you
have
nothing
to
fear
but
fear
itself'
have
not
yet
felt
the
crows.
"Your
bidding,
master!"
"To
our
end."
"Indeed!"
"The
end
is
near!"
"Yes,
my
master."
"Are
you
afraid?"
"Fear
me."
"I
feel
your
fear..."
"I
think
I'll
let
you
suffer
for
a
while..."
"I
haven't
got
a
brain,
and
soon...
neither
will
you!"
Fiddlesticks
laughs.
"Oh,
yes!"
Fiddlesticks
laughs.
Fiddlesticks
was
designed
by
Summoners!
Some
of
you
may
be
aware
that
today
is
a
very
special
day.
On
a
day
just
like
this
one,
two
years
ago,
a
group
of
around
50
developers
got
together
and
launched
a
game
that
would
grow
into
a
phenomenon:
League
of
Legends.
That's
right,
summoners!
League
of
Legends
is
two
years
old
today!
We've
grown
and
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds
since
release,
and
with
your
participation
we're
hosting
millions
of
epic
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
countries
all
over
the
world.
And
so
today,
to
celebrate
this
milestone,
we're
throwing
a
party.
And
who
better
to
help
us
get
the
drop
on
everyone
than
Surprise
Party
Fiddlesticks!
To
commemorate
two
years
of
pitched
battles
on
the
Fields
of
Justice,
we're
pleased
to
bring

festive
take
on
your
favorite
Harbinger
of
Doom;
a
legendary
skin
for
only
975
Riot
Points!

startling
new
take
on
Fiddlesticks
will

New

sinister
sound
effects
on
all
of
Fiddlesticks'

A
shocking
new
model
featuring
party
hats
and
balloons.
Frighteningly
festive
