As
you
may
have
noticed,
we've
been
releasing
some
champions
that
really
challenge
existing
gameplay
paradigms.
And
this
next
one
is
no
exception.
In
addition
to
a
haircut
that
defies
the
very
laws
of
physics,
the
latest
and
greatest
from
our
design
team
is
sporting
some
pretty
edgy
magical
abilities.
Meet
Ezreal
the
Prodigal
Explorer,
a
champion
who
breaks
new
ground
–
in
both
gameplay
and
fashion
–
here
at
the
League
of
Legends.
If
you're
feeling
rather
passionate
about
skill-shots
these
days,
start
getting
excited,
because
this
particular
gentleman
should
really
scratch
that
itch.
Can
you
feel
the
electricity
in
the
air?
Test
drive
all
the
high-tech
advancements

to
cram
into
Pulsefire
Ezreal
.
Now
that
you've
had
a
look
under
the
hood,
what
do
you
guys
think?
Should
we
do
the
Pulsefire
Ezreal
treatment
for
other
champions?
Summoners!
There's
been
a
question
hanging
in
the
air
on
the
