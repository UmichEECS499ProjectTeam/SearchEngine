For
those
who
brave
the
harsh
seas
of
,
attaining
one’s
own
ship
and
crew
is
the
pinnacle
of
success.
Sarah
Fortune,
a
well-respected
(some
would
say
legendary)
bounty
hunter
from
,
was
able
to
achieve
this
feat
just
after
her
sixteenth
birthday,
etching
out
her
name
as
the
go-to
gal
for
resolving
special
troubles.
No
bounty
was
too
difficult
or
too
dangerous
for
her
feminine
charm
and
her
renowned
use
of
her
twin
pistols,
"Shock
and
Awe".
Her
success
gave
her
the
means
to
legitimately
purchase
her
own
ship
-
with
a
little
flirtatious
haggling,
of
course.
Things
weren’t
always
so
fortunate
for
Miss
Fortune,
though.
When
she
was
young,
trade
ships
began
to
dot
the
horizon
of
her
quiet
home
along
the
northern
shores
of
largest
chunk.
Trade
routes
brought
piracy,
and
the
inhabitants
soon
found
themselves
caught
in
a
frenzy
of
pillage.
One
day,
young
Sarah
returned
home
to
hear
gunshots
and
screaming.
Her
front
door
was
smashed
open;
inside,
she
saw
her
mother
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood.
A
sudden
blow
to
her
head
made
her
collapse
next
to
her
slain
mother.
The
last
thing
she
could
remember
were
her
attacker’s
red
eyes,
as
his
face
was
blocked
by
a
rogue’s
bandanna.
Miss
Fortune
has
a
strong
distrust
for
pirates
and
she
finds
herself
constantly
bickering
with
the
infamous
(the
only
captain
to
resist
her
charms)
over
the
direction
of
Bilgewater
politics.
Her
two
goals:
to
unite
the
people
of
Bilgewater,
making
them
into
a
strong
and
independent
society,
and
to
find
the
pirate
who
killed
her
mother.
To
that
end,
she
has
entered
as
a
,
trading
her
skills
for
the
wealth
and
influence
that
will
help
her
accomplish
both.

in
the
sneak

by

"More
men
have
voluntarily
surrendered
to
the
care
of
Miss
Fortune
than
any

bounty
hunter."
―
"Fortune
doesn't
favor
fools!"
"The
fun
begins."
"Nothing
but
powder

"I
always
shoot
first."
"No
prey,
no

"Guns

"Bang!"
"Step
to."
"Not
a
problem."
"I

what
I'm
doing."
"Set

"Sure
you
can
handle
me,
summoner?"
"You've
got
dangerous
eyes...
I
like
that."
"Don't
get
cocky."
"I've
got
a
good
feeling
about
this."
"Watch
your
mouth
kid,
or
you'll
find
yourself
respawning
at
home!"
"How
do
you
like
my
guns...
Shock,
and
Awe!"

With
the
recent
increase
in
ninja
population
at
the
Institute
of
War,
there
has
been
some
PR
backlash
amongst
pirate
enthusiasts.
For
those
like
myself,
who
proudly
sail
under
the
Black
Flag,
Riot
Games
has
asked
me
to
inform
you
that
you
have
not
been
forgotten!
Every
scurvy
dog
has
his
day,
and
very
soon,
you
shall
have
yours!
To
appease
these
constituents,
we
have
our
latest
pirate
champion
coming
up!
Her
name
is
Miss
Fortune,
the
Bounty
Hunter,
and
she’s
got
everything
a
lady
buccaneer
should
offer.
I
mean,
just
check
out
the
pair
on
her!
Those
are
some
seriously
huge,
enormous,
titanic
pistols
she’s
got
there!
That’s
right,
pistols.
What
did
you
think
I
was
talking
about?
So
start
getting
excited!
Miss
Fortune
will
be
sailing
into
your
port,
soon!
