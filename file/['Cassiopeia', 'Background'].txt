Once
her
tryst
was
over,
Cassiopeia
provisioned
her
father
with
information
regarding
the
barbarian
resistance.
As
she
divulged
this
intelligence,
a
wave
of
revulsion
washed
over
her.
She
screamed
in
agony
as
her
silky
skin
hardened
to
scales,
her
lustrous
hair
thickened
to
leather,
and
her
manicured
fingernails
sharpened
to
claws.
Dazed,
she
fell
upon
a
group
of
horrified
servants,
rending
them
limb
from
limb
in
a
heartbeat.
When
it
was
over
the
blood
soaked
figure
was
no
longer
the
ravishing
jewel
of
the
Noxian
court,
but
a
horror
trapped
somewhere
between
woman
and
serpent.
Unable
to
serve
in
her
traditional
capacity,
Cassiopeia
departed

service

While
her
sister
has
always
been
the
most
celebrated
member
of
the
household,
the
Du
Couteau
family
has
a
long
history
of
service
to
.
It
has
often
been
said
that
no
soldier
has
ever
been
as
fortunate
as
General
Du
Couteau
to
have
been
graced
with
daughters.
His
youngest,
Cassiopeia
-
despite
lacking
her
sister's
killer
instincts
-
was
equally
renowned
in
at
court
for
her
stately
character
and
elegance.
Cunning
as
she
was
beautiful,
the
temptress
could
never
be
found
far
from
the
arm
of
any
foreign
dignitary,
her
wiles
prying
secrets
from
the
lips
of
even
the
most
wary
attaché.
With
the
Noxian
barbarian
pacification
campaign
having
ground
to
a
standstill,
Cassiopeia
had
set
her
sights
on
a
diplomat
from
a
tribe
of
the
region.
Thinking
him
an
easy
mark,
the
scheming
seductress
set
about
beguiling
him.
He
refused
to
confide
in
her,
however,
until
she
swore
an
oath
of
secrecy
upon
his
sword
-
a
strange
weapon
with
a
serpentine
curve
to
the
blade.

"Don't
you
find
me...
beautiful?"
"Surrender
to
me."
"Feel
my

"I
strike."
"No

"I'll
take

once."

you

'please'."

"Don't

"Tell

"I'm

"You're
no

"Eventually,
they
all
come

back."
"You
think
I'm
a
freak;
let
me
get
on
your
level."
"Let
me
help
shuffle
off
your
mortal
coil."
"They
say
the
key
to
beauty
lies
in
grace
and
poise.

League
of
Legends
summoners
are
a
diverse
group
and
it's
a
tough
job
to
satisfy
everyone's
personal
taste.
Some
people
love
horrid,
terrifying
monsters;
some
love
ravishing,
beautiful
women;
some
gallant,
spinning
knights,
and
still
others
pint-sized
fighting
terrors.
Now,
since
there
are
so
many
passionate
summoners
out
there,
we've
decided
to
make
this
latest
champion
breaks
down
the
barriers
that
separate
these
enthusiasts.
Allow
me
to
present
the
fruits
of
those
labors:
Cassiopeia,
the
Serpent's
Embrace.
Whether
you're
a
fan
of
maidens
or
monsters,
this
champion
is
sure
to
satisfy.
Unless,
of
course,
you're
gun
shy
about
ladies
with
scales,
fangs,
claws,
and
deadly,
poisonous
liquids.
Then
