In
,
any
citizen
may
rise
to
power
regardless
of
race,
gender,
or
social
standing
--
strength
is
all
that
matters.
It
was
with
committed
faith
in
this
ideal
that
Riven
strove
to
greatness.
She
showed
early
potential
as
a
soldier,
forcing
herself
to
master
the
weight
of
a
long
sword
when
she
was
barely
its
height.
She
was
ruthless
and
efficient
as
a
warrior,
but
her
true
strength
lay
in
her
conviction.
She
entered
battles
without
any
trace
of
doubt
in
her
mind:
no
ethical
pause,
no
fear
of
death.
Riven
became
a
leader
amongst
her
peers,
poster
child
of
the
Noxian
spirit.
So
exceptional
was
her
passion
that
the
High
Command
recognized
her
with
a
black
stone
rune
sword
forged
and
enchanted
with
Noxian
sorcery.
The
weapon
was
heavier
than
a
kite
shield
and
nearly
as
broad
-
perfectly
suited
to
her
tastes.
Soon
after,
she
was
deployed
to
as
part
of
the
Noxian
invasion.
What
began
as
war
quickly
became
extermination.
Noxian
soldiers
followed
the
terrifying
war
machines
across
fields
of
death.
It
wasn't
the
glorious
combat
for
which
Riven
trained.
She
carried
out
the
orders
of
her
superiors,
terminating
the
remnants
of
a
beaten
and
fractured
enemy
with
extreme
prejudice.
As
the
invasion
continued,
it
became
clear
that
the
Ionian
society
would
not
be
reformed,
merely
eliminated.
During
one
bitter
engagement,
Riven's
unit
became
surrounded
by
Ionian
forces.
They
called
for
support
as
the
enemy
closed
in
around
them.
What
they
received
instead
was
a
barrage
of
biochemical
terror
launched
by
.
Riven
watched
as
around
her
Ionian
and
Noxian
alike
fell
victim
to
an
unspeakably
gruesome
fate.
She
managed
to
escape
the
bombardment,
though
she
could
not
erase
the
memory.
Counted
dead
by
Noxus,
she
saw
an
opportunity
to
start
anew.
She
shattered
her
sword
--
severing
ties
with
the
past
--
and
wandered
in
self-imposed
exile.
Now
she
seeks
atonement
and
her
own
way
to
serve
the
pure
Noxian
vision
in
which
she
believed.

If
there's
anything
that
we've
learned
over
the
course
of
the
years
here
at
Riot
Games,
it's
that
it
pays
to
be
prepared
for
any
eventuality.
Take
this
next
champion
for
instance.
Riven,
the
Exile,
is
here
to
show
you
that
you
can
still
be
a
badass
even
if
your
sword's
been
broken.
Now
take
a
moment
to
appreciate
what
she
could
probably
do
with
a
complete
weapon,
because
you
just
might
find
out!
Greetings
Summoners!
With
Riven
on
the
horizon,
I
wanted
to
take
a
few
minutes
and
give
you
all
a
sneak
peek
into
some
of
her
gameplay
and
mechanics.
Riven
is
a
flow-based
fighter
who
performs
aggressive
combo
attacks
to
decimate
her
opponents.
This
often
involves
her
stepping
forward
into
her
sword
swings
to
chase
down
cowardly
enemies
who
might
try
to
escape
or
utilize
their
ranged
attacks
to
avoid
direct
combat.
This
highly
mobile
fighting
style
makes
her
a
really
aggressive,
momentum-based
character.
Her
signature
ability
is
Broken
Wings,
a
3-part
combo
slash
that
causes
her
to
step
forward
and
slash
nearby
enemies.
On
her
3rd
hit,
Broken
Wings
unleashes
a
nova,
knocking
nearby
enemies
back.
While
performing
the
three-hit
Broken
Wings
combo
is
powerful
in
its
own
right,
more
veteran
Riven
players
will
find
great
opportunities
to
mix
in
her
Ki
Shout
to
deliver
a
short
stun
(for
her
to
follow
up
with
more
devastation)
or
move
into
an
even
better
position
with
Valor.
Her
ultimate,
Blade
of
the
Exile,
allows
her
to
reform
her
broken
sword,
restoring
her
former
power
and
allowing
her
to
activate
Wind
Slash,
a
powerful
shockwave
that
slices
the
air
itself
to
cut
down
enemies
that
are
out
of
reach.
We're
excited
about
Riven
because
she
draws
some
heavy
inspiration
from
fighting
games,
utilizing
combos
that
can
be
interspersed
with
other
abilities
to
change
timing
and
effect
as
needed.
This
flow
and
feel
is
something
we
feel
will
appeal
highly
to
aggressive
players
who
want
to
make
split-second
decisions
on
when
to
deal
damage
and
when
to
sacrifice
damage
in
favor
of
additional
utility
effects.
