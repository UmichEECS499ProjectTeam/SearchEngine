Ashe
draws
back
her
arrow
but
hits
her
eye
with
it
instead.
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman.
The
Freljord
is
home
to
many
vicious
ice
storms,
but
none
compare
to
the
Gelid
Vortex
-
a
swirling,
icy
maelstrom
which
circles
the
northern
hemisphere.
Ashe
was
leading
a
squadron
of
elite
archers,
her
closest
companions,
when
they
found
themselves
caught
in
this
wintery
nightmare
at
the
end
of
a
week-long
standoff
with
a
warring
tribe.
When
she
came
to,
Ashe
was
surrounded
by
the
tattered
corpses
of
friends
and
enemies
alike.
Only
divine
providence
had
spared
her
from
the
whirling
shards
of
ice,
and
her
hair
had
turned
the
color
of
the
arctic
tundra.
Ashe
never
again
wore
the
traditional
Freljord
White
Garments
of
Victory.
"One
tribe,
one
people,
one
Freljord."
―
"It's
a
good
idea
to
spread
out.
Ashe
can
hit
five
birds
with
one
arrow."
―
"It
is
our
duty
to
speak
of
unity,
here
among
the
ruins
of
our
past.
Now
our
people
stand
divided,
torn
apart
by
ancient
hatreds.
Brothers
and
sisters,
our
enemy
is
our
neighbor.
Our
enemy
is
a
land
without
law
and
a
long
winter's
night.
It
is
hunger,
poverty,
desperation
and
chaos.
Look
around
you,
these
monuments
from
a
bygone
age,
each
older
and
grander
than
anything
wrought
by
our
hands.
These
are
the
works
of
a
united
Freljord,
a
fractured
land
that
we
can
repair.
From
these
ruins,
we
can
raise
a
great
nation.
We
are
the
people
of
the
Freljord,
and
this
land
belongs
to
us
all."
―
"All
the
world
on
one
arrow."
"Right
between
the
eyes!"
"My
aim
is
steady."
"Avarosa
guide
me."
"My
arrows
fly
true."
"I
won't
miss!"
"Lead
the
target."
"Make
it
count."
"I
only
need
one
shot!"
"Let's
see
how
close
they
can
get."
"No
one
escapes
my
aim."
"Strike
quickly!"
"For
the
Freljord!"
"Let
fly!"
"Swiftly,
now!"
"We
must
press
on!"
"Do
not
confuse
mercy
for
weakness!"
"Peace
requires
a
steady
hand."
"Never
lose
focus."
"Stand
together!"
"Faster
than
my
arrow?
I
think
not."
"I
won't
lead
us
astray."
"United,
we
are
stronger!"
"We
are
one
people."
"I
will
unite
the
Freljord."
"I
do
my
best
work
from
afar."
"We're
on
the
right
path."
"I
always
take
the
high
ground."
"How
do
you
like
the
curves?
I
was
talking
about
the
bow."
"Take
a
good
look;
it's
the
last
you'll
get."
"Keep
staring...
just
don't
look
behind
you."
"Misguided
warmonger!"
"Foolish
Sejuani."
"So,
which
one
is
the
pig?"
"To
pierce
your
black
heart!"
"Your
twisted
ways
must
be
stopped!"
"I
will
end
your
corruption!"
"No,
really,
put
that
apple
on
your
head...
ugh!
Ah...
ohh...
hmm..."
"I
don't
have
to
see
you
to
shoot
you...
ow!
Ugh...
ooh,
really?"
"Ha
hah!
Check
this
out...
ow!
Ugh,
who
makes
a
bow
out
of
ice?!"
Ashe
laughs.
Ashe
laughs.
Ashe
laughs.
Ashe
laughs.
"Reveal
what
is
hidden."
"Lead
the
way."
"Show
me
a
path!"
"The
fate
of
our
people
hangs
in
the
balance."
"The
Freljord
unites!"
Ashe

designed
by
