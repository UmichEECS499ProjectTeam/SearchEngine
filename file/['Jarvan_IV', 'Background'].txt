As
the
royal
family
of
for
centuries,
members
of
the
Lightshield
line
have
spent
their
lives
waging
war
against
any
who
opposed
Demacian
ethics.
It
is
said
that
every
Lightshield
is
born
with
anti-
sentiment
in
his
blood.
Jarvan
IV
is
no
exception,
even
though
he
is
the
first
Lightshield
born
to
the
age
of
the
.
As
his
forefathers
had
before
him,
he
led
Demacian
troops
into
bloody
engagements
with
Noxian
forces,
and
on
many
occasions
he
has
bled
alongside
wounded
allies
and
fallen
comrades.
In
his
most
crushing
defeat,
he
was
outmaneuvered
and
captured
by
a
Noxian
battalion
under
the
command
of
.
This
mistake
nearly
cost
him
his
life
at
the
hands
of
,
but
he
was
rescued
by
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
an
elite
Demacian
strike
force
led
by
Jarvan's
childhood
companion,
.
Those
close
to
him
believed
that
his
capture
had
changed
him.
was
quoted
as
saying:
"His
eyes
never
seemed
to
look
at
you,
only
through
you
to
something
he
could
not
look
away
from."
One
day,
without
warning,
Jarvan
IV
handpicked
a
squad
of
Demacian
soldiers
and
left
Demacia,
vowing
to
find
"atonement".
He
began
by
tracking
and
hunting
the
most
dangerous
beasts
and
bandits
he
could
find
in
northern
,
but
he
soon
tired
of
such
prey.
Seeking
something
that
only
he
understood,
he
ventured
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
He
wasn't
heard
from
again
for
nearly
two
years.
After
many
had
assumed
the
worst,
he
returned
to
glorious
fanfare
on
the
streets
of
Demacia.
His
Demacian
plates
were
adorned
with
the
bones
and
scales
of
creatures
unknown.
His
eyes
bore
the
wisdom
of
someone
twice
his
age.
Of
the
twelve
soldiers
who
had
departed
with
him,
only
two
returned.
In
a
tone
as
cold
and
steady
as
steel,
he
swore
to
bring
the
enemies
of
Demacia
to
their
knees.
Jarvan
IV
stands
as
if
giving
a
rallying
speech
but
accidentally
crushes
his
toes
with
his
lance
and
hops
on
one
foot.

They
say
that
you
can
tell
a
lot
about
a
man
by
the
way
he
carries
himself.
Of
course,
if
he's
heavily
armored
and
toting
around
a
gigantic
spear,
that
might
say
something
about
him,
too.
It
is
my
pleasure
to
introduce
to
you
Jarvan
IV,
the
Exemplar
of
Demacia,
a
man
whose
attire
may
tempt
you
to
harbor
some
preconceived
notions
about
his
personality.
Just
remember
that
looks
aren't
everything.
This
gentleman
is
also
the
Crown
Prince
of
Demacia
and
a
real
class
act
The
Demacian
junior
summoner
who
was
initially
appointed
to
greet
Jarvan,
alas,
experienced
an
unfortunate
accident.
He
needed
to
be
replaced
at
the
last
minute
by
a
young
summoner
from
Bilgewater
with
an
eye
for
both
coin
and
advancement.
It
seems
the
new
boy
penciled
Jarvan
in
for
an
early
Judgment,
and
judged
he
will
be,
though
not
by
the
League.
Welcome
Jarvan,
I've
waited
a
long
time
for
this.
Royalty
has
its
perks.
What
worth
is
a
Prince
who
cheats
to
best
an
obstacle
surmounted
by
his
subordinates?

Prince
Someday...

Pray
Royalty
has
its
perks…
