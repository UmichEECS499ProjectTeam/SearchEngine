It
was
the
first
time
in
years
Zyra
had
sensed
a
creature
wander
so
close.
Hunger
drew
her
to
the
sorceress,
but
some
other,
deeper
instinct
compelled
her.
She
enveloped
the
woman
in
thorns
with
ease,
but
as
she
savored
this
final
meal,
foreign
memories
invaded
her
thoughts.
She
saw
great
jungles
of
metal
and
stone
where
humans
and
animals
thrived.
Potent
magic
surged
through
her
vines,
and
she
devised
an
elegant
but
risky
plan
to
survive.
Using
the
woman’s
memories,
Zyra
poured
her
newfound
magic
into
the
creation
of
a
human-shaped
vessel.
She
didn’t
know
what
sort
of
awaited
her,
but
she
had
nothing
left
to
lose.
When
Zyra
opened
her
eyes,
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
raw
power
ready
at
her
fingertips.
It
wasn’t
until
she
noticed
the
shriveled
remains
of
the
plant
she
once
was
that
she
realized
how
vulnerable
she
had
become.
If
this
body
died,
there
would
be
no
network
of
vines
to
retreat
through,
no
roots
to
regrow
her...but
she
felt
truly
alive.
She
beheld
the
world
for
the
first
time
as
animals
did,
and
a
dark
smile
crept
across
her
lips.
She
was
reborn,
and
there
was
so
much
now
within
her
grasp.

Longing
to
take
control
of
her
fate,
the
ancient,
dying
plant
Zyra
transferred
her
consciousness
into
a
human
body
for
a
second
chance
at
life.
Centuries
ago,
she
and
her
kind
dominated
the
,
using
thorns
and
vines
to
consume
any
animal
that
set
foot
in
their
territory.
As
the
years
passed,
the
animal
population
steadily
died
off.
Food
became
increasingly
scarce,
and
Zyra
could
only
stand
by
helplessly
as
the
last
of
her
kin
withered
away.
She
thought
she
would
perish
alone,
until
the
appearance
of
an
unwary
sorceress
presented
her
with
an
opportunity
for
salvation.

Sometimes
the
most
dangerous
predators
in
the
wild
are
the
ones
you'd
never
expect
–
even
the
vegetation
in
Valoran!
Zyra,
mysterious
and
alluring,
is
one
powerful
plant
that
is
poised
and
ready
to
unleash
nature's
fury
on
the
League
of
Legends.
As
fierce
as
she
is
relentless,
Zyra
uses
the
deadly
vines
and
wild
overgrowth
of
the
Plague
Lands
as
her
weapons,
planting
seeds
on
the
battlefield
that
spring
to
life
into
powerful
allies.
Are
you
the
type
that
takes
great
joy
in
laughing
maniacally
as
the
thorns
rise
up
around
your
foes,
shredding
them
to
pieces
with
the
power
of
nature
itself?
If
so,
you'll
go
wild
for
Zyra,
Rise
of
the
Thorns.
Are
you
ready
to
meet
one
of
the
fiercest
and
deadliest
champions
ever
to
step
foot
out
of
the
Valoran
wilds?
Meet
Zyra,
Rise
of
the
Thorns.
This
floral
femme
fatale
packs
a
lot
of
petals
and
punch,
planting
seeds
directly
on
the
battlefield
and
springing
them
to
life
into
deadly
plant
allies.
As
a
plant
mage,
Zyra’s
kit
revolves
around
her
ability
to
sow
and
transform
seeds
through
Rampant
Growth.
Zyra
can
store
up
seeds
using
an
ammo
system,
dropping
these
seemingly-harmless
buds
on
the
ground
to
grant
limited
vision
while
they
remain
active.
Seeds
aren’t
too
threatening
on
their
own,
and
enemies
can
even
move
over
a
seed
to
stomp
it
out
of
existence
at
only
the
cost
of
revealing
their
position
on
the
map
for
a
few
seconds.
Zyra’s
full
fury
blooms,
however,
when
you
use
her
other
abilities
to
interact
with
her
seeds.
On
its
own,
Deadly
Bloom
causes
damage
to
enemies
caught
in
the
area
of
effect
after
a
slight
delay.
Seeds
caught
in
the
area
of
effect,
however,
will
spring
to
life
as
a
ravenous
Thorn
Spitter
with
a
ranged
attack.
Likewise,
Zyra’s
Grasping
Roots
ability
deploys
a
line
attack
that
roots
enemies
caught
in
its
path
for
a
moderate
duration.
Seeds
affected
by
Grasping
Roots
transform
into
Vine
Lashers
armed
with
a
shorter-range
attack
that
slows
enemies.
Zyra
can
even
drop
a
seed
in
the
path
of
an
ability
she’s
just
cast
to
surprise
her
enemies
with
an
instant
plant-to-the-face.
To
seal
the
deal,
Zyra
can
invoke
her
ultimate
ability,
Stranglethorns,
to
afflict
an
area
with
an
infestation
of
thorny
vines
that
deal
significant
damage
as
they
spread
out.
After
a
brief
delay,
the
vines
retract
again,
knocking
any
enemies
still
within
the
area
of
effect
into
the
air.
Any
of
Zyra’s
plants
touched
by
the
Stranglethorns
become
enraged,
gaining
a
hefty
bit
of
attack
speed
and
growing
to
an
imposing
size.
Zyra
can
execute
some
intense
combos
with
her
abilities,
playing
off
seed
placement
to
lock
enemy
champions
into
a
fight
with
the
deadly
wilds
themselves.
The
road
to
create
a
champion
occasionally
has
some
bumps
along
the
way.
Zyra,
Rise
of
the
Thorns,
is
no
exception.
Originally,
the
concept
of
a
plant-based
champion
was
in
our
designer’s
heads
for
over
a
year.
Try
after
try,
it
just
never
felt
perfect.
Different
concept
art,
multiple
kits,
loads
of
designers
–
Zyra
saw
it
all.
Finally,
the
brush
parted
to
reveal
the
final
concept
that
just
kicked
ass
and
worked
on
all
levels.
But
don’t
take
our
word
for
it:
,
,
and
are
here
to
dish
out
the
inside
dirt
on
Zyra,
from
the
style
of
her
splash
art
and
abilities
to
the
challenge
of
creating
the
soundscape
for
a
plant
person.
