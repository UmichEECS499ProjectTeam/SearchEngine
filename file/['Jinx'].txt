Jinx
the
Loose
Cannon
or
Release
date
Whenever
a
champion
or
tower
that
Jinx
has
dealt
damage
to
within
the
last
3
seconds
is
killed
or
destroyed,
she
gains
175%
movement
speed
that
decays
over
4
seconds.
Additional
Information:
Jinx's
basic
attacks
grant
bonus
attack
speed
for
2.
seconds,
stacking
up
to
3
times.
The
stacks
decay
one
at
a
time
when
she
stops
attacking
with
her
minigun.
Switching
to
her
Rocket
Launcher
will
not
clear
any
active
stacks,
but
they
will
not
grant
attack
speed
after
her
first
attack.
Jinx
gains
bonus
attack
range
and
deals
bonus
damage
on
her
attacks,
at
the
cost
of
mana
per
attack.
Additionally,
her
attacks
will
splash,
dealing
full
damage
to
all
enemies
in
a
~150-radius
area.
The
bonus
damage
to
her
target
and
the
splash
damage
both
scale
additively
with
critical
strikes.
Additional
Information:
After
a
short
delay,
Jinx
fires
a
shock
blast
that
deals
physical
damage
to
the
first
enemy
hit,
also
granting
sight
and
slowing
it
for
2
seconds.
Additional
Information:
Jinx
tosses
out
3
chompers
that,
after
an
arm
time
of
0.
seconds,
explode
on
contact
with
enemy
champions
dealing
magic
damage
over
1.
seconds
to
enemies
within
~50-unit
area.
The
champion
that
sets
off
the
chomper
is
also
rooted
the
same
duration.
Chompers
explode
automatically
after
5
seconds.
A
single
champion
can
only
set
off
a
single
chomper,
but
can
be
damaged
by
any
number
if
they
remain
in
range.
Additional
Information:
Jinx
fires
a
rocket
that
travels
in
a
line,
exploding
on
the
first
enemy
champion
hit.
Enemies
caught
in
the
explosion
take
physical
damage
equal
to
a
base
amount
(this
amount
increases
over
the
first
second
the
rocket
travels)
plus
a
percentage
of
their
missing
health
(max.
300
vs.
minions
and
monsters
).
The
primary
target
of
the
explosion
takes
full
damage,
while
nearby
enemies
take
80%
damage.
