Kennen
is
a
champion
who
relies
heavily
on
combos.
Some
simple
combos
are:
+
+
(passive)
+
-
this
combo
works
extremely
well
from
levels
3-5
(ie
before
is
learned).
At
level
2,
Kennen
can
do
a
+
(passive)
+
combo
to
result
in
a
highly
damaging
stun
and
a
few
auto
attacks
during
the
stun.
Once
reaching
level
6,
Kennen
gains
the
ability
to
stun
an
opponent
twice
using
a
+
+
(passive)
+
+
combo.
The
key
to
playing
well
is
learning
how
to
chain
his
combos
together
to
be
able
to
land
free
damage
on
the
enemy
while
keeping
them
in
a
disadvantageous
position.
A
good
way
to
build
Kennen
is
a
balanced
build,
which
focus
on
building
tankiness
as
well
as
damage.
With
all
three
skills
at
rank
2,
Kennen
becomes
a
powerful
enemy.
is
amazing
for
turning
team
fights
around.
It
is
key
that
his
R
is
used
as
much
as
possible
against
multiple
opponents,
but
only
at
the
right
time.
Kennen
tends
to
be
an
initiator
or
to
follow
immediately
behind
an
initiator
thanks
to
.
Using
wisely
in
a
team
fight,
in
conjunction
with
and
,
nearly
guarantees
a
viable
amount
of
energy
gained
from
because
Kennen's
cooldowns
tend
to
end
more
quickly
than
Kennen's
energy
regenerates.
Remember
that
also
provides
you
with
a
great
boost
of
your
armor
and
magic
resistance
meaning
it
can
save
you
from
fatal
situations
like
Karthus'
or
skills
that
do
damage
over
time,
notice
however
that
it
won't
reduce
true
damage.
One
of
's
biggest
strengths
is
his
flexibility
of
item
builds
in
any
given
situation.
Kennen
can
easily
be
built
either
as
an
attack
damage
carry
or
an
ability
power
based
carry.
He's
also
a
very
powerful
top
laner
in
both
attack
damage
and
ability
power
based
builds
due
to
his
decent
attack
damage
scaling
and
passive
and
split
pushing
ability
because
his
can
serve
as
a
good
escape
mechanism
in
sticky
situations
as
well
as
serving
a
good
pushing
skill
in
conjunction
to
his

Getting

Kennen
to
be
a
strong

with
the

effective
items
on
Kennen.
If
Kennen

played
as
a
caster,

useful
for
increasing
the
amount
of

he
does,
especially
since
his
can
be
used

rank

be
very
good
with
his

since
you
can
get
very
fast
to
any
opponent
and
slow

this
way,
and
once

be
comboed
easily.

you
with

It's
recommended
to
build
AP
along
with
defensive
items
as
Kennen's
full
combo
requires
getting
close
to
enemy
champions
and
therefore
survivability
will
be
a
must
during
teamfights.
Giving
Kennen

good
for
the

it
gives
him
some
AP

who
