http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus/Background
For
his
incomparable
skill
with
the
bow
and
his
unquestioned
sense
of
honor,
Varus
was
chosen
to
be
the
warden
of
a
sacred
temple.
The
temple
was
built
to
contain
an
ancient
pit
of
corruption
so
vile
that
Ionian
Elders
feared
it
could
envelop
the
island
in
darkness.
Varus
prided
himself
on
his
position,
as
only
the
most
exceptional
Ionian
warriors
were
selected
for
the
role.
He
lived
with
his
family
in
a
nearby
village
and
led
a
quiet
life
of
disciplined
routine
until
the
day
the
forces
of
invaded
Ionia.
Their
shock
troops
left
nothing
but
death
and
desolation
in
their
wake,
and
the
temple
lay
in
their
path.
Varus
was
forced
to
make
a
decision.
He
was
bound
by
honor
to
stay
and
defend
the
temple,
but
without
him
the
village's
few
inhabitants
could
offer
little
resistance
against
the
oncoming
war
machine.
Gravely,
he
chose
to
fulfill
his
duty
as
a
warden.
The
corruption
could
not
be
allowed
to
escape.
His
arrows
sundered
the
troops
who
tried
to
wrest
the
temple
from
him
that
day.
However,
when
he
returned
to
his
village,
he
found
that
it
had
been
reduced
to
a
smoldering
graveyard.
Remorse
at
the
sight
of
his
slain
family
gave
way
to
overwhelming
regret
and
then
to
seething
hatred.
He
swore
to
slaughter
every
Noxian
invader,
but
first
he
needed
to
become
stronger.
He
turned
to
that
which
he
had
sacrificed
everything
to
protect.
The
pit
of
corruption
would
consume
him
wholly,
as
a
flame
devours
a
wick,
but
its
abominable
power
would
burn
within
him
until
he
was
lost.
This
was
a
path
from
which
there
could
be
no
return.
With
grim
resolve,
he
condemned
himself
to
the
black
flames,
feeling
malevolent
energy
bond
to
his
skin...
and
with
it,
the
promise
of
ruin.
He
left,
seeking
the
blood
of
all
Noxians
involved
with
the
invasion,
a
grisly
task
that
eventually
led
him
to
the
invasion's
most
infamous
perpetrators
in
.

If
you've
been
wondering
what
can
happen
when
someone
really,
truly
lets
their
dark
side
get
the
best
of
them,
then
look
no
further
than
Varus,
the
Arrow
of
Retribution.
This
dangerous
combination
between
caster
and
ranged
carry
is
equipped
with
a
number
of
abilities
designed
to
both
whittle
enemies
down
from
range,
and
allow
him
to
close
in
for
the
kill.
The
lynchpin
in
Varus'
kit
is
Piercing
Arrow
–
a
long
ranged
skill
shot
attack
that
damages
enemies
in
a
line.
Pressing
Q
will
cause
Varus
to
draw
back
his
bow,
reducing
his
movement
speed,
but
steadily
ramping
up
damage
and
range
(up
to
a
cap)
until
you
left
click
to
select
a
target.
Through
creative
positioning
Varus
can
either
use
this
skill
to
pepper
enemies
with
long
range
attacks
or
close
out
a
kill
on
a
fleeing
enemy
with
a
hard-hitting
shot.
In
lane,
Varus'
unique
combination
of
abilities
gives
him
the
ability
to
apply
constant
pressure
to
his
opponent.
Piercing
Arrow
allows
him
to
both
farm
safely
and
damage
enemy
champions
without
fear
of
reprisal.
Meanwhile,
the
area
of
effect
healing
debuff
from
Hail
of
Arrows
complicates
a
support
champion's
efforts
to
out-heal
the
attrition
damage.
When
the
time
comes
to
move
in
for
the
kill,
Living
Vengeance
keeps
Varus'
attack
speed
high
while
he’s
last
hitting,
enabling
him
to
quickly
stack
up
Contamination
charges
from
Blighted
Quiver
in
preparation
for
a
finishing
blow.
In
team
fights,
Varus'
long
range
allows
him
to
maintain
safe
positioning
until
he's
able
to
score
a
kill
on
an
enemy
champion.
Once
he's
picked
off
an
enemy,
the
massive
attack
speed
boost
from
Living
Vengeance
combined
with
area
of
effect
crowd
control
from
Chains
of
Corruption
make
him
a
truly
terrifying
sight
on
the
battlefield.
