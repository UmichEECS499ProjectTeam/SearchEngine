"While
the
future
may
be
mysterious
and
unknown
to
most,
Twisted
Fate
is
certain
that
his
future
lies
within
the
cards."
"Lady
luck
is
smilin'."
"Pick
a
card."
"All
or
nothin'."
"I
never
bluff."
"Let's
raise
the
stakes."
"Looks
like
trouble."
"Let
it
ride."
"I
got
this."
"Nobody
touches
the
hat."
"I
reckon."
"Doin'
it."
"Deal
'em."
"It's
all
in
the
cards."
"Just
the
luck
of
the
draw."
"It's
my
lucky
day."
"Don't
mind
if
I
do."
"I'm
one
of
a
kind."
"Always
on
the
run."
"Lookin'
good."
"Charmed,
I'm
sure."
"Never
lost
a
fair
game...
or
played
one."
"Cheater's
just
a
fancy
word
for
winner."
"Only
two
Jokers
in
the
deck,
and
I
get
dealt
you."
"Only
a
fool
plays
the
hand
he's
dealt."
"Ándale,
heheheh..."
"Giddy
up!
Heheheh..."
Twisted
Fate
laughs.
Twisted
Fate
laughs.
Twisted
Fate
laughs.
Twisted
Fate

blue."
"Eyes
open."

as
day."
"Blood
red."
"Seein'
red."
"Thorned
rose."
"Shinin'
gold."
"Hold
it,
partner."
"Lucky
them."
"No
fightin'
Destiny."
"It
ain't
luck,
it's
Destiny."
"I'm
already
gone."
"I'm
gone."
"Gotta
hit
the
trail."
"Dead
in
his
tracks."
"Tough
luck,
Malcolm."
"Simmer
down,
hotshot."
