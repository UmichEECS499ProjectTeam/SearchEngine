Free
of
flesh
and
bone,
Xerath
held
nearly
infinite
power
at
his
command.
However,
in
the
wake
of
his
chaotic
ritual,
the
mages
of
Shurima
feared
his
careless
disregard
for
life
would
bring
ruin
to
the
kingdom.
After
a
terrible
struggle
they
subdued
Xerath,
but
they
could
not
destroy
his
ascended
form.
Instead
they
trapped
him
within
an
enchanted
sarcophagus
and
sealed
him
in
an
underground
tomb.
Eons
passed,
civilizations
rose
and
fell,
and
Xerath's
imprisonment
was
lost
to
memory.
For
centuries,
Xerath's
vast
power
tore
away
at
the
sarcophagus
and
weakened
its
spell.
Finally,
he
willed
forth
a
burst
of
magic
that
shattered
his
prison,
but
its
core
remained,
containing
Xerath
and
his
power
within
its
broken
pieces.
Seeking
to
rid
himself
of
this
burden,
he
was
drawn
to
the
magic
of
and
found
he
could
absorb
their
power.
Yet
the
nexuses
had
gatekeepers:
petty
mages
known
as
.
Xerath
knew
his
key
to
true
freedom
from
his
prison
lay
in
gaining
their
trust,
and
he
offered
his
power
to

Xerath's
image
and
release
date

In
the
ancient
civilization
of
,
the
mage
called
Xerath
practiced
magic
with
undying
passion.
He
believed
that
with
enough
magical
power,
he
could
gaze
into
the
heart
of
to
know
the
secrets
of
history
and
the
universe
beyond.
Such
magic
was
beyond
the
limitations
of
a
mortal
body,
but
Xerath
obsessively
pursued
a
path
to
infinite
power
nonetheless.
With
every
breakthrough
he
grew
more
and
more
powerful,
yet
not
without
consequence.
Xerath's
increasing
arcane
abilities
wrought
havoc
on
his
physical
form.
Desperate,
he
undertook
a
dangerous
ritual
to
transcend
his
dying
body.
The
outcome
would
be
immortality
or
self-destruction.
Violent
magic
unleashed
during
the
ritual
caused
devastation
throughout
Shurima,
but
when
the
dust
settled,
Xerath
emerged
as
an
ascended
being
of
pure
arcane
energy.

At
Riot
Games
a
big
part
of
our
corporate
culture
is
breaking

barriers
through
innovation.
And,
while
we’re
on
the
subject,
this
seems
like
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
introduce
our
latest
champion.
Meet
Xerath,
the
Magus
Ascendant.
Previously
one
of
the
most
powerful
mages
in
Valoran,
Xerath’s
learned
the
hard
way
just
what
sort
of
trouble
accepting
constraints
–
in
this
case
a
gigantic,
enchanted
sarcophagus
–
can
get
you
into.
Of
course,
even
a
chained
Magus
Ascendant
is
somebody
you
want
to
avoid
underestimating.
Greetings
Summoners!
Xerath,
the
Magus
Ascendant,
is
our
newest
mage-type
character
in
League
of
Legends.
His
playstyle
offers
a
new
way
to
perform
the
mage-carry
role;
long
range
barrages
and
sieging.
The
cornerstone
of
this
is
in
his
ability
Locus
of
Power.
This
makes
Xerath
immobile,
but
gives
his
spells
massively
increased
range
and
defense
penetration.
This
really
allows
him
to
set
up
and
barrage
an
area
before
becoming
mobile
again
to
perform
a
more
standard
mage
role.
Using
this
range
gameplay,
Xerath
has
wide-area
spells
he
can
use
to
really
saturate
an
area
with
major
damage.
Arcanopulse,
his
bread-and-butter
ability,
shoots
a
short-delay
beam
at
the
area,
zapping
anyone
hit
for
significant
damage.
Arcane
Barrage,
his
ultimate,
allows
him
to
launch
up
to
three
massive
explosions
at
a
long
range,
both
doing
area
denial
and
good
team
damage.
To
protect
himself,
Mage
Chains
is
a
reliable
single-target
spell
that
will
allow
Xerath
to
stun
an
enemy
if
he
hits
him
with
a
subsequent
spell.
Xerath
is
something
we
liken
to
a
Howitzer
or
artillery
piece.
He
should
really
appeal
to
people
who
enjoy
very
long
ranges
and
like
aiming
skillshots
and
leading
targets.
We’re
excited
to
offer
a
new
mage
paradigm
to
League
of
Legends,
and
will
be
continuing
to
add
new
ways
to
play
existing
roles
into
the
game.
If
you’ve
been
waiting
for
that
new
Xerath
skin
that
really
gets
you
all
hot
and
bothered,
your
long
wait
is
over.
Scorched
Earth
Xerath
is
exploding
onto
the
Fields
of
Justice
for
all
you
budding
pyrotechnicians,
fireworks
enthusiasts
and
anybody
else
who
thinks
the
process
of
combustion
is
really,
really
cool.
Featuring
an
appropriately
incendiary
complement
of
new
spell
effects
befitting
his
fiery
new
look,
this
is
one
take
on
the
Magus
Ascendant
you
won’t
want
to
miss.
