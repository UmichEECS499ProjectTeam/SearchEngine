In
dark
halls,
hidden
from
society,
Elise
preached
the
word
of
a
mythical
.
Her
desperate
followers
hungered
for
the
god's
favor,
believing
its
blessings
to
be
the
source
of
Elise's
vibrance
and
power.
When
Elise
proclaimed
that
she
would
lead
a
pilgrimage
to
the
spider
god's
shrine,
she
selected
only
her
most
devout
disciples
to
join
her.
Ecstatic,
the
chosen
few
followed
her
blindly
as
she
led
them
on
a
perilous
journey
across
the
sea.
When
they
came
ashore
at
their
final
destination,
the
mysterious
,
Elise
led
them
to
a
cavern
shrouded
in
webs.
Expecting
a
shrine,
the
group
looked
to
their
priestess
in
confusion.
She
turned
to
the
crowd
and
raised
her
arms
in
triumph,
revealing
strange,
spider-like
legs
that
grew
out
of
her
back.
Seeing
her
terrifying
true
form
for
the
first
time,
Elise's
followers
turned
to
flee,
but
she
conjured
magical
webs
to
trap
them.
With
her
victims
ensnared,
she
turned
to
face
the
cave
and
uttered
a
screeching
cry.
An
enormous
undead
spider-beast
emerged
from
the
darkness,
dragging
its
hideous
bulk
on
thick,
pointed
legs.
Elise's
followers
could
only
scream
as
the
monstrous
spider
ate
them
alive.
She
approached
the
sated
creature,
extracted
its
venom,
and
drank
the
strange
substance.
An
immediate
sense
of
rejuvenation
flowed
through
her
veins.
With
mortality
delayed
once
again,
Elise
left
to
rejoin
her
congregation.
They
were
overjoyed
to
hear
that
their
fellows
had
chosen
to
remain
at
the
spider
god's
sacred
home.
Elise
reassured
her
disciples
that
she
would
lead
another
pilgrimage
in
due
time.
The
spider
god
would
be
waiting.

the
following
unique
responses:
It
was
rumored
that
the
Spider
Queen
was
reworked
into
,
since
that
was
the
name
used
for
the
Spider
Queen
at
the
time.
Also,
in
early
development,
Nidalee
used
poison
in
all
of
her
attacks
and
her
Prowl
caused
her
to
become
camouflaged.
However,
on
May

,
2010,
stated:
It
was
later
believed
that
Priscilla
had
been
reworked
into
because
of
the
physical
similarities,
though
it
was
uncertain
whether
or
not
their
abilities
shared
any
similarities.
There
was
a
poll
on
the
League
of
Legends
forums
petitioning
for
Riot
to
bring
the
Spider
Queen
into
the
game.

"The
truly
faithful
need
not
fear
the
spider's
embrace."
―
"Elise's
regal
demeanor
and
captivating
charms
belied
the
feeling
of
dread
she
conjured
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach.
Something
in
the
deceptively
musical
timbre
of
her
voice
gave
the
impression
there
was
a
monstrous
beast
locked
away
beneath
that
unearthly
smile.
I
looked
around
at
her
spellbound
followers,
and
could
not
shake
the
feeling
that
they
were
ensnared
like
insects
in
a
web,
awaiting
some
horrible
fate."
―
"As
the
fog
parted
and
I
first
beheld
the
Shadow
Isles,
I
sensed
immediately
that
something
was
amiss.
From
the
mysteriously
placid
waters
of
the
bay
to
the
dead
calm
of
the
night
air,
an
eerie
stillness
gripped
the
place
–
even
the
sea
and
sky.
Even
as
I
made
ready
to
go
ashore,
the
crew
begged
me
to
return
at
once
to
the
mainland."
―
"Despite
its
size,
the
immense
forest
loomed
like
a
sepulcher
around
us,
and
the
dank
air
and
unnatural
stillness
bred
increasing
feelings
of
paranoia
and
dread.
My
companion
begged
me
to
turn
back,
but
some
primal
yearning
spurred
me
onward,
deeper
into
the
gloom."
―
"The
Shadow
Isles
–
They
say
they
don't
exist.
Mythical
islands
haunted
by
ghosts
and
specters.
Tales
to
frighten
children.
But
I
know
better.
I
have
been
there.
When
I
first
set
foot
there
I
immediately
knew
something
was
wrong
with
that
place.
My
skin
crawled
and
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
I
felt
a
terrible
revulsion.
Life
didn't
belong
there.
But
I
also
knew...
somehow,
deep
inside
I
knew,
that
the
islands
welcomed
me.
They
wanted
me."
"Then
I
heard
the
song;
the
spider's
song.
My
companion
cried
out
in
terror
and
fell
to
his
knees.
I
embraced
him.
I
told
him
he
had
nothing
to
fear.
He
was
going
to
a
better
place.
I
will
take
them
to
a
better
place."
―
"Only
the
spider
is
safe
in
her
web."
"I
know
what
lurks
in
the
shadows."
"I
know
the
true
path."
"There's
nothing
to
fear."
"Pull
the
strings.
Watch
them
dance."
"We
must
all
make
sacrifices."
"I
can
show
them
the
way
to
divinity."
"My
true
beauty
is
beneath
the
skin."
"They
need...
guidance."
"Every
web,
a
masterpiece."
"I
have...
refined
tastes."
"The
spider
demands
sacrifice."
"Ah,
the
tangled
webs
we
weave."
"Dangling
by
a
thread."
"Weak
willed
fools!"
"It
will
all
be
over
soon."
"I
hear
a
man
likes
a
lady
with
legs."
"Hmm,
why
so
tense?
Relax."
"Come
closer,
I
don't
BITE!"
"The
spider,
I.
And
you,
the
fly."
Elise
laughs.

two
legs?"
"I
lurk
in
every
shadow."
"Now
I
thrive!"
"Skitter
along,
my
pets."
"Nothing
escapes

of

poison."

my
hunger!"

mess."

delicious."

pain

fleeting."

This
patch,
we'll
welcome
a
champion
with
a
lot
of
history
into
the
League
of
Legends
lineup:
Elise,
the
Spider
Queen.
Originally
concepted
over
three
years
ago,
Elise
proved
to
be
a
challenging
champion
to
fully
realize.
Finally
coming
together
as
a
transform
champion,
Elise
has
the
ability
to
assume
the
form
of
either
a
regal
mage
or
a
deadly
spider
assassin.
Like
all
transform
champions,
successfully
playing
Elise
involves
balancing
two
distinct
kits.
More
than
any
of
her
counterparts,
however,
the
Spider
Queen's
two
forms
embody
distinct,
but
complimentary
roles.
Unlike
Jayce,
whose
kit
emphasizes
flowing
smoothly
between
ranged
and
melee
skillsets,
or
Nidalee,
who
uses
her
cougar
mobility
to
split
push
and
create
distance
for
her
long
ranged
attacks,
Elise's
two
ability
sets
separate
definitively
into
mage
and
assassin
roles.
In
her
human
mage
form,
Elise
specializes
in
keeping
her
distance
using
low-cooldown
nukes
and
crowd
control
abilities.
Her
spells
emphasize
wearing
down
high-health
targets
in
preparation
for
a
brutal
finish
in
spider
form.
At
the
heart
of
this
gameplay
is
Neurotoxin
which
deals
damage
based
on
the
opponent's
current
health.
While
in
this
form,
she
also
generates
a
spiderling
each
time
she
casts
a
spell.
Upon
transformation
into
a
spider,
she
summons
these
spiderlings
to
fight
alongside
her.
Investing
the
time
to
build
up
your
minion
count
is
essential
to
performing
a
perfect
assassination.
Once
she's
switched
to
her
spider
assassin
form,
Elise's
kit
takes
on
an
entirely
different
theme.
She
gains
a
number
of
bonuses
to
her
melee
capabilities,
and
her
spiderlings
become
active
to
help
rapidly
damage
an
opponent.
Using
Rappel,
she
can
ascend
above
the
battlefield,
vanishing
from
sight
and
becoming
untargetable
for
a
short
duration.
Once
she's
suspended,
she
can
lower
herself
upon
a
nearby
target,
surrounding
them
with
spiderlings.
Boosting
her
minions'
attack
speed
with
Skittering
Frenzy
can
quickly
burst
down
a
surrounded
enemy,
leaving
them
vulnerable
to
execution
with
Venomous
Bite.
Using
both
spider
and
human
form
effectively
is
the
key
to
making
the
most
out
of
the
Spider
Queen.
Having
the
good
judgment
to
stay
safe
in
your
mage
form
while
you
fight
to
create
the
opportunity
for
a
clean
spider
kill
will
make
or
break
your
success
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
