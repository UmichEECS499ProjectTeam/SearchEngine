Be
wary
of
chasing
as
she
can
easily
place
seeds
in
her
wake,
creating
a
pseudo
obstacle
course
of
plants
which
may
cause
your
pursuit
to
result
in
death.
Attempting
to
connect
skill
shots
with
over
her
seeds
can
be
problematic.
Zyra
may
use
her
seeds
as
shields,
activating
her
plants
in
front
of
your
shots.
It
is
important
to
note
that,
although
plants
will
block
skill
shots,
seeds
in
and
of
themselves
will
not
hinder
shots
of
any
kind.
During
early
game,
try
to
determine
which
skills
is
leveling
first.
A
Zyra
that
levels
her
Q
first
will
rely
more
on
direct
damage
and
less
on
CC,
so
she
should
be
harassed
more
aggressively.
When
she
levels
her
W
first,
she
will
try
to
harass
more
often
than
usual
but
rely
on
seeds
more
for
damage,
so
staying
away
from
the
seeds
or
forcing
her
away
from
them
will
hurt
Zyra's
game.
A
Zyra
that
levels
her
E
first
will
have
powerful
CC,
but
since
the
plants
and
her
E
have
short
range
(narrow
hit-box),
moving
around
a
lot
will
leave
struggling
to
deal
damage.
ultimate
has
a
large
AoE,
but
it
can
be
evaded
at
the
edges,
since
it
takes
a
while
before
the
vines
damage
the
edges,
so
a
quick
teleport
or
simply
moving
away
will
leave
her
ultimate
wasted.
So,
Zyra,
when
trying
to
setup
for
a
good
ultimate,
she
will
usually
plant
1
or
more
seeds
and
activate
them
with
her
E
to
keep
her
target
in
place.
Since
has
no
targeting
abilities,
a
teleporting
champion
such
as
Ezreal,
Kassadin
or
Katarina
can
prove
to
be
very
problematic
for
her.
As
a
jungler,
wait
for
to
use
her
E,
as
it
is
her
only
escape
mechanism,
and
then
strike.
Just
remember
that
her
plants
can
continue
to
attack
no
matter
what
happens
to
Zyra
and
that
her
passive
works
very
well
in
combination
with
her
slowing
plants,
allowing
her
to
revenge
kill
you
when
you
made
it
out
at
low
health.
