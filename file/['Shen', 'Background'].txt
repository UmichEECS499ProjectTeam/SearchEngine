There
exists
an
ancient
order
originating
in
the
Isles
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
balance.
Order,
chaos,
light,
darkness—all
things
must
exist
in
perfect
harmony,
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
universe.
This
order
is
known
as
the
and
it
employs
a
triumvirate
of
shadow
warriors
to
uphold
its
causes
in
the
world.
Shen
is
one
of
these
shadow
warriors,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Watching
the
Stars
-
exercising
judgment
untainted
by
prejudice.
Born
to
a
clan
whose
members
have
decorated
the
ranks
of
the
Kinkou
for
generations,
Shen
was
trained
his
entire
life
to
become
the
Eye
of
Twilight,
and
thereupon
to
dispassionately
determine
what
must
be
done
in
the
interests
of
equilibrium.
As
his
final
trial
to
ascend
to
this
position,
he
was
made
to
attend
the
Takanu,
a
ceremony
in
which
his
father
was
tortured
before
his
eyes
to
test
his
resolve.
Any
reaction
whatsoever
would
have
resulted
in
his
immediate
disqualification,
but
he
never
averted
his
gaze
and
never
blinked,
not
once.
As
the
Eye
of
Twilight,
Shen
must
make
decisions
which
would
buckle
the
wills
of
ordinary
men,
removing
all
emotion
from
the
equation.
He
now
works
with
his
fellows
and
to
enforce
the
balance
of
.
This
hallowed
pursuit
has
unsurprisingly
led
the
triumvirate
to
the
Fields
of
Justice.

"The
Eye
of
Twilight
sees
not
the
despair
of
its
victims,
only
the
elegance
of
equilibrium."
"A
demonstration
of
superior
judgement."
"It
must
be
done."
"Enforced
equilibrium."
"I
find
them
unworthy."
"Target
marked."
"With
honor."
"Understood."
"With
balanced
steps."
"Our
wills
align."
"Press
on."
"From
the
shadows."
"So
I
go."
"Tread
carefully."
"Without
a
sound."
"There
is
no
dispute."
"Immediately."
"You're
already
dead,
you
just
haven't
caught
up
yet."
"If
light
travels
so
fast,
how
come
it's
never
caught
a
ninja?"

Ever
since
joined
,
we
have
been
weathering
a
virtually
constant
influx
of
nepotism
complaints
from
organizations
in
a
certain
clandestine
industry.
The
exact
source
of
these
complaints
has
been
difficult
to
verify,
however,
due
to
their
reclusive
and
mysterious
natures.
Luckily,
our
talented
public
relations
department
(with
the
help
of
a
few
favors
from
some
friends
in
the
CIA)
has
managed
to
pinpoint
the
exact
source
of
this
criticism,
and
we
have
decided
that
it
is
a
demographic
that
we
cannot
afford
to
ignore.
For
those
who
haven't
yet
devised
the
identity
of
this
group,
I
am,
naturally,
talking
about:
ninjas.
In
an
effort
to
keep
ninja
public
opinion
on
our
side,
it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
I,
on
behalf
of
the
Design
Team,
am
empowered
to
introduce:
Shen,
the
Eye
of
Twilight.
For
those
of
you
who
have
been
waiting
with
bated
breath
to
sport
your
ninja
pride,
courage!

don’t
let
