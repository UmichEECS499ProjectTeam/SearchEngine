The
Tidecaller's
sacred
duty
is
to
acquire
a
moonstone,
a
powerful
object
found
only
in
the
towering
reaches
of
the
surface
world.
Her
people,
the
Marai,
rely
on
the
moonstone's
light
to
ward
off
the
terrors
of
the
depths.
However,
the
stone's
power
lasts
only
one
hundred
years.
Before
its
light
fades,
the
Tidecaller
must
journey
into
the
Great
Deep,
retrieve
an
abyssal
pearl,
and
carry
it
to
the
surface.
There,
on
the
night
of
the
winter
solstice
of
the
hundredth
year,
the
Tidecaller
makes
a
ceremonial
exchange
with
a
landwalker
bearing
a
moonstone.
By
trading
the
pearl
for
the
moonstone,
the
Tidecaller
ensures
the
survival
of
the
Marai
for
another
century.
However,
in
Nami's
time,
as
the
hundred
years
drew
to
a
close,
no
Tidecaller
had
been
found.
Without
a
chosen
one
to
complete
the
quest,
her
people
would
face
disaster,
but
the
Marai
waited
in
faith
that
the
Tidecaller
would
appear.
Nami
refused
to
sit
idle,
insisting
that
without
a
Tidecaller
to
save
them,
someone
had
to
act.
Bravely,
she
decided
to
begin
the
quest
herself
and
ventured
alone
into
the
dangerous
depths.
None
expected
her
to
survive,
but
after
six
days
of
battles
with
untold
horrors,
Nami
returned
with
the
pearl
in
hand.
The
Marai
hailed
her
as
the
new
Tidecaller.
All
that
remained
was
for
Nami
to
journey
to
the
surface
and
complete
the
exchange.
When
Nami
arrived
at
the
surface,
however,
she
found
only
an
empty
shore.
She
waited
for
days
in
a
mystic
cove,
unsure
of
what
to
do.
In
all
the
legends
of
the
Tidecallers,
the
bearer
of
the
moonstone
had
never
failed
to
arrive.
Nami
faced
a
choice.
She
knew
the
surface
world
only
through
tale
and
rumor,
but
the
survival
of
the
Marai
depended
upon
her.
Summoning
the
tide
to
bear
her
ashore,
Nami
began
her
search
for
the
moonstone
and
became
the
first
of
her
kind
to
explore
the
world
above
the
ocean.
She
left
her
home
behind,
and
vowed
not
to
return
until
she
had
completed
the
Tidecaller's
quest.
Nami
summons
three
small
sharks
which
swim
around
her,
and
makes
them
jump.
Nami
taunts
her
foe
and
splashes
them
with
water.

Nami
channels
the
primal
energies
of
the
ocean,
harnessing
its
mystical
restorative
properties
and
commanding
the
raw
power
of
the
tides
themselves.
Though
many
doubted
her,
Nami
had
the
bravery
and
determination
to
take
on
a
dangerous
quest
when
no
one
else
would.
Now
her
people
believe
she
is
the
Tidecaller,
a
chosen
one
destined
to
complete
a
quest
essential
to
the
survival
of
her
entire
race.
"I
am
the
tide,
and
I
cannot
be
turned."
―
"I
decide
what
the
tide
will
bring."
"Quit
flopping
around."
"There's
always
another
wave."
"Swim
against
the
current."
"I'll
find
my
path."
"Sure
as
the
tides."
"Great,
more
dry
land."
"We
are
all
tied
to
the
ocean."
"Ride
upon
the
waves."
"Feet
are
strange."
"People
and
their
air..."
"The
softest
water
wears
down
the
hardest
rock."
"My
people
are
counting
on
me."
"I
still
hear
the
song
of
the
sea."
"I
will
see
my
home
again."
"My
quest
beckons."
"Eww,
whale
breath."
"They're
puddle
monsters
at
best."
"Do
not
force
my
hand."
"The
seas
are
rising."
"Wash
them
away."
"Welcome
to
the
deep
end."
"Water
can
heal...
or
harm."
"Let
the
seas
reclaim
them."
"Douse
'em."
"Have
a
drink."
"Soak
it
up."
"This
is
minnow's
play."
"Bottom
feeders."
"The
ocean
will
sweep
them
away."
"The
sea
has
no
pity."
"Sometimes
you're
the
catch.
Sometimes
you're
the
bait."
"The
sea
holds
fearsome
creatures...
and
them."
"I
moonlight
as
a
shark
caller."
"You're
in
over
your
head."
"Afraid
to
get
your
feet
wet?"
"Swim
at
your
own
risk."
Nami
laughs.
Nami
laughs.
"Yeah!"
Nami
laughs.
"Oceans

forth!"
"High
tide!"
"Hey,

"Cool
out,

Hey
folks,
As
I’ve
been
hinting
at
for
a
little
while
now,
the
next
champion
is
our
new
character.
While
we’ll
get
to
the
details
on
her
in
the
next
few
days,
I
wanted
to
pull
back
the
curtain
on
what
“support
champion”
means
when
we
set
out
to
create
one.
First
up,
let’s
discuss
the
differences
between
support
characters,
and
the
lane
assignment
of
support
–
they
overlap
a
lot,
but
they’re
not
the
same:
Support
characters
are
defined
by
being
assisters
and
enablers
for
their
allies
–
this
is
the
core
“support
psychology”
we
want
to
achieve.
Good
examples
of
these
characters
are
,
or
.
Support
as
a
lane
role
is
any
character
that
can
thrive
on
less
gold,
and
has
a
strong
lane
presence
–
either
offensively
or
defensively.
Characters
from
the
previous
definition
often
fit
here,
but
other
characters
go
here
a
lot.
For
example:
is
a
tank,
but
plays
the
support
role
in
a
team.
is
a
little
of
both
because
he’s
a
great
linebacker.
So,
with
that
out
of
the
way:
when
we
talk
about
a
support
character
(like
Nami
–
the
new
one!)
we
mean
the
first
definition.
,
while
able
to
play
the
support
role,
is
not
a
support
champion
by
these
definitions
–
she’s
more
like
a
mage
with
an
off-spec.
So,
why
should
you
care
about
Nami?
Let
me
tell
you!
She
brings
a
combination
of
defensive
utility
(including
a
way
to
heal
in
combat
situations!)
and
offensive
“set-up”
She's
the
water
caster
that
you’ve
anticipated
for
a
long
time
–
with
a
support
leaning
She's
a
regal
mermaid
–
an
archetype
I
think
we
can
agree
is
a
needed
addition
to
the
League
lineup
Her
offensive
setup
features
a
skillshot-style
paradigm,
something
supports
have
only
really
had
with
Lulu;
we
wanted
to
expand
a
bit
While
this
is
the
concept
art
and
the
final
has
changed
(as
all
concepts
do
through
development),
she’s
drawn
by
the
ridiculously
talented
Gem
Lim
We’ve
learned
a
lot
of
lessons
from
our
supports,
and
think
Nami
shows
how
we
can
make
a
character
who
satisfies
the
core
support
psychology,
and
is
healthy
for
the
game.
And
with
our
commitment
to
developing
a
variety
of
champions,
you’ll
be
seeing
more
supports
coming
next
year
–
so
this
is
far
from
the
last
example
of
that.
Look
for
more
exact
details,
including
skills
and
more
art,
in
the
upcoming
days
–
and
you
will
be
able
to
check
out
Nami
on
the
Public
Beta
Realm
soon,
too.
The
newest
support
champion
to
join
the
League
is
Nami,
the
Tidecaller.
A
water
caster
who
channels
the
primal
energies
of
the
ocean,
Nami
harnesses
water's
restorative
properties
and
commands
the
raw
power
of
the
tides
themselves.
As
a
support
with
powerful
crowd
control
abilities,
Nami's
kit
gives
her
the
potential
to
impact
every
phase
of
your
games.
In
lane,
Nami
excels
at
applying
constant
pressure
to
the
enemy.
The
buffs
provided
by
Tidecaller's
Blessing
allow
her
lane
partner
to
come
out
ahead
in
exchanges,
and
the
long-distance
stun
from
Aqua
Prison
can
keep
low
health
enemies
from
engaging
safely.
Moreover,
because
her
healing
skill
also
bounces
to
damage
nearby
enemies,
Nami's
core
support
abilities
work
best
when
her
partner
is
on
the
attack.
In
the
mid
game,
when
teamfights
become
more
frequent,
the
utility
of
Ebb
and
Flow
increases.
The
more
champions
the
wave
can
bounce
to,
the
more
efficient
it
becomes.
You
can
use
Aqua
Prison
and
Tidal
Wave
to
disrupt
opponents'
positioning
with
stuns
and
slows,
and
take
advantage
of
her
passive
combined
with
Tidecaller's
Blessing
to
help
chase
down
a
fleeing
enemy
champion.
With
her
potent
combination
of
crowd
control
and
buffs,
Nami
continues
to
have
a
substantial
presence
in
team
fights
once
the
transition
is
made
to
the
late
game.
Even
though
she's
not
on
the
front
lines
dishing
out
damage,
Nami
becomes
a
fantastic
initiator
through
the
range
of
her
ultimate.
The
enormous
distance
covered
by
the
rushing
Tidal
Wave
can
easily
force
a
teamfight,
or
allow
her
team
to
disengage
while
their
opponents
are
slowed
under
the
weight
of
the
tide.
Balancing
her
offensive
capabilities
and
defensive
utility
will
be
crucial
to
success
with
Nami.
Learn
to
ride
the
rolling
wave,
and
you
may
find
your
team
swimming
to
victory.
