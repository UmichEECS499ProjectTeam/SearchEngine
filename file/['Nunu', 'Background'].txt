This
Monday,
the
minds
that
brought
you
Gentleman
Cho'gath
and
Corporate
Mundo
have
a
very
special
surprise
in
store
for
you:
The
Legendary
Nunu
Bot!
Deep
within
Freljord's
numerous
mountain
ranges
lies
the
top
secret
AngryGoran
Robotics
Facility.
There
the
most
brilliant
(and
angry)
minds
in
all
of
Runeterra
work
to
achieve
with
science
that
which
nature
has
failed
to
provide.
Their
mission:
To
build
the
perfect
Yeti!
Decades
(and
numerous
home
video
production
cycles)
have
passed
since
their
first
attempts.
Now,
after
thousands
of
failed
prototypes,
power
outages,
welding
accidents,
patent
office
claims,
and
a
rather
considerable
electricity
bill,
AngryGoran
engineers
have
finally
completed
construction
on
the
next
evolution
of
fully
functional
combat
Yeti.
Nunu
Bot
is
officially
operational
and
ready
to
be
deployed
to
the
Fields
of
Justice!
This
May
2nd,
visit
the
League
of
Legends
store
and
fire
up
your
very
own
Nunu
Bot!
"Willump
and
I
have
a
whole
world
to
explore.
Don't
get
in
our
way!"
â€•
"Imagine
what
Nunu
will
be
like
when
he
grows
up!"
"Here
we
go!"
"Swallowed
you
whole!"
"The
yeti
knows
the
way!"
"Let's
make
tracks!"
"I'm
on
it!"
"It's
cold
out
there..."
"Don't
make
the
yeti
angry,
You
won't
like
him
when
he's
angry!"
"Can't
catch
me!"
"Don't
make
the
yeti
angry.
You
won't
like
him
when
he's
angry!"
"Speak
softly...and
ride
a
big
yeti!"
Willump
laughs.
Willump
laughs.
Willump
laughs.
"You
will
feel
my
rage
now."
"My
ultimate
will
devastate
them...or
not."
"You
are
now
on
my
Ignore
list."
"Stop
feeding."
"Everything
is
going
according
to
my
plan."
"Towerdive!
We
must
towerdive!"
"My
master
tactics
will
win."
"Witness
my
superior
playstyle
and
see
it."
"Now
you
will
see
what
happens
when
you
listen
to
my
superior
plans."
"Yeti-bot
speaking."
"Welcome
to
Nunu
Champion
Spotlight,
presented
by
Yeti
Bot."
"Do
I?"
"Are
you
freaking
kidding
me?"
"I
will
surprise
them
with
my
decision."
"I
must
think...
and
act
fast."
"I
have
a
bad
feeling
about
this."
"Man,
I'm
good."
"I
will
push
forward
and
make
my
boldness
known"
"Bots
are
superior
to
non-bots."
"You
must
say
miss!
That's
a
constructive
criticism."
"When
I
first
met
you,
I
was
the
bot.
Now
I
am
the
super-bot."
"Now
watch
and
learn
from
my
moves,
just
like
I've
learned
from
Phreak's."
"I
feel
so
good
now.
So
fed.
Almost
as
members
of
Riot
when
they
created
me."
"Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha."
"Delicious."
"Yummy."
