strong
AoE
damage/silence
ability,
especially
in

with

Due
to
his
basic
attacks
being
melee,
you
can
first
use
Rupture
to
knock
up
your
target,
then
close
the
gap
sufficiently
within
the
time
to
silence
them
with
Feral
Scream,
preventing
effective
escaping
or
retaliation.
Due
to
the
strong
slow
applied
by
Rupture,
it
is
unlikely
they
will
be
out
of
melee
range
before
the
silence
expires,

you
to
finish

Note
that
if

to
fire

opposite
direction
of

it
would
often
be
launched
in
the
wrong
angle
and
become
counterproductive.

It
can
sometimes
be
a
good
idea
to
toggle

to
prevent
yourself
from
pushing

too
far
and
thereby
opening
yourself
up
to
ganks.
If
you
don't
toggle

when
attacking

an
enemy
champion
can
stand
near

you
will
hit

you.
If

try

you're

as
the
true
damage
you
deal
exceeds
the
health

It
is
advisable
to
gain
6
stacks
first
by

and
using
it
to
last
hit

champions

are
too
close,
since

damage

significantly
larger

a
base
damage
of

Building
as
an
AP

is
reasonably
viable
because
of
his
high
AP
scalings,
and
a
true

ultimate
that
could
easy
hit
over

any
target
with
sufficient

His
main
weakness
is

must
go
into

range
to

use

However,
with

would
be
better
for
him
to
use

However,

it

opponents

However,
if

he
would
quickly
heal

This,
combined
with
his
low
mobility,
encourages
you
to
call
for
a

commit
to
killing
him
instead

Save
your

until

uses

However,

Rupture's
cooldown
is

seconds,

a
Cho'Gath

be
very
difficult
to
channel
against.
Be
wary
of
chasing
a
weakened
champion
into

when
Cho'Gath
is
around.
It
will
make
it
much
easier
for
him
to
land

the
rest

as
negating
his
lack
of

you
with

Build
magic
resistance
to
mitigate
his

but
know
that

true

not

helps
against
