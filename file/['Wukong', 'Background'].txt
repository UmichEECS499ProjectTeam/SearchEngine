During
the
chaos
of
the
Rune
Wars,
an
enormous
runestone
was
lost
deep
within
the
.
It
remained
there,
untouched
for
centuries,
emanating
a
potent
magic
which
infused
nearby
wildlife
with
sentience
and
vitality.
A
group
of
monkeys
who
were
particularly
empowered
by
it
came
to
worship
the
stone,
and
their
leader
-
a
wise
sage
-
became
convinced
that
he
could
harness
its
power
to
make
the
monkeys
immortal.
He
performed
an
elaborate
ritual,
but
things
didn't
go
as
he
expected.
The
runestone
was
destroyed,
and
instead
of
granting
immortality,
it
produced
Kong,
a
monkey
who
carried
in
his
heart
the
strength
and
power
it
had
contained.
Kong
was
driven
by
an
unquenchable
desire
for
greatness.
He
sought
out
every
beast
and
monster
the
Plague
Jungles
could
offer,
eager
to
find
a
worthy
opponent,
but
none
offered
the
challenge
he
craved.
He
asked
the
sage
for
advice,
and
learned
about
a
legend
of
hairless
monkeys
to
the
north
who,
with
wits
and
might,
had
bent
the
world
to
their
will.
Kong
left,
journeying
north,
determined
to
discover
if
the
legend
was
true.
He
crossed
the
Southern
Wastes
and
then
the
Great
Barrier.
On
his
way,
he
happened
upon
,
who
was
deep
in
meditation.
Kong
asked
him
who
the
strongest
warrior
in
the
north
was,
and
Yi
told
him
about
.
The
tale
intoxicated
Kong,
a
place
where
he
could
battle
the
strongest
fighters
in
the
world
was,
to
him,
paradise.
Kong
asked
Yi
to
introduce
him
to
this
League,
and
to
teach
him
the
ways
of
humans,
so
that
he
could
be
a
fitting
champion.
In
return,
he
would
honor
Yi
by
using
Yi's
Wuju
style
to
become
the
greatest
warrior
Runeterra
had
ever
seen.
Admiring
his
passion,
Yi
agreed,
but
under
the
condition
that
Kong
would
one
day
teach
the
lessons
of
Wuju
to
a
pupil
of
his
own.
In
the
spirit
of
this
agreement,
he
renamed
Kong
and
gave
him
a
weapon
suited
to
his
unusual
nature
-
an
enchanted
staff
that
the
young
Doran
had
crafted.
The
weapon
was
an
unrivalled
masterpiece.
Guided
by
Yi,
Wukong
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
prove
himself
as
the
best,
and
to
show
the
world
the
true
power
of
Wuju.
Wukong
plants
his
staff
in
the
ground
and
extends
it
to
immense
lengths.
