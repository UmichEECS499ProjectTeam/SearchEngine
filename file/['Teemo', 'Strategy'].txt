When

an

of

or
at

of

closest
to
their

and
wait
for

to
start
farming.

can
be
used
in-between

which
allows

rapid-fire
attacks.
This
is
extremely
important
to
learn
how
to
use
throughout
the
game.
Opening

a
normal

immediately

proceeding
to

apply
great

very
quickly,
allowing

all

Using
with
your
poison
can
ensure
kills
on
fleeing
enemies.
One
strategy
is
to
place
some
in
your
lane
and
wait
for
the
enemy
to
push.
After
this,
go
into

Then,
after
the
enemy
runs
into

can
be
used
to
farm
creep
waves
very
effectively;
it
is
best
to
keep
your
mushrooms
spread
out
and
not
too
close
to
each
other.
If
a
lane
has
enemy
minions
stacking
on
each
other
(especially
the
ranged
minions),
pop
a
down
in
the
middle
of
them
and
watch
them
all
die
in
just
a
few
seconds.
Use
this
only
if
you
need
to
stop
a
wave
immediately
or
stop
future
waves,
because
it
is
necessary
to
maximize
potential
damage
by
increasing
the
number
of
active
shrooms
on
the
map
to
win.
More
shrooms
=
more
chances
of
hitting
them
=
more
net
damage.
Put

key
locations
on
the
map,

as

to
reveal
when
your
enemies
might
be
attempting
to
kill
them
or
to
prevent
opponents
from
ganking
and
make
counter
ganks.
This
is
similar
to
a

the
range
that

much
smaller.
(Tip:
Place

them
from
starting

or

while

will
allow
you
to
see
the
health
of
the

and
whether

Put
a

and

to
your

or
your

side
of
the

to
ensure
maximum
safety.
When
fighting
against
a

be
careful
because
if
he
uses
any
near
any
ally
will
be
revealed.
When
laying
down
in
the
jungle,
keep
in
mind
that
the
champion
movement
pathing
often
hugs
the
terrain
as
they
take
the
shortest
route
to
the
selected
location.
Laying
traps
against
walls
at
turning
points
will
increase
the
chance
enemies
will
run
into
them
on
their
way
to/from
lanes.
Placing
down
shrooms
in
the
center
will
allow
for
a
more
permanent
ward
(sometimes).
Also,
when
laying
traps
in
a
lane,
remember
that
minions
travel
through
the
middle,
and
if
the
front
minion
runs
into
it
only
he
and
one
minion
behind
him
will
be
hit.
Placing
them
on
the
sides
can
increase
the
chances
of
hitting
a
champion.
Placing

or
blue

is
generally
a
good
idea
considering
you
might
just
get
lucky
and
steal
it
from
them
while
slowing
their
farming
down.
It's
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
place
a
few
behind
you
before
entering
a
teamfight,
that
way
if
you
begin
to
lose,
your
team
can
run
off
and
lead
the
enemy
right
into
a
minefield.

that

Doing
this
