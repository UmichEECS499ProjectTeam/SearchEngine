Xerath
the
Magus
Ascendant
or
Release
date
Every
12
seconds,
Xerath's
next
basic
attack
will
restore
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
(27
+
/
/
/
/
at
each
level)
mana.
The
amount
of
mana
restored
is
doubled
if
the
attack
target
is
a
champion.
This
does
not
apply
to
structures.
Additional
Information:
Xerath
starts
charging,
gradually
increasing
the
range
of
Arcanopulse
while
decreasing
his
movement
speed
by
up
to
50%
over
the
next
1.
seconds.
While
charging,
Xerath
cannot
attack
or
use
his
other
abilities.
,
Arcanopulse
cancels
and
half
the
mana
cost
is
refunded.
After
a
brief
cast
time,
Xerath
fires
a
beam
of
energy
in
a
line
that
deals
magic
damage
to
all
enemies
hit.
Additional
Information:
Xerath
calls
down
a
blast
of
arcane
energy
which
strikes
after
a
0.
second
delay,
dealing
magic
damage
and
slowing
enemies
in
a
target
200-radius
area
by
10%
for
2.
seconds.
Enemies
hit
directly
take
an
empowered
amount
of
damage
and
are
slowed
by
a
greater
amount
instead.
The
empowered
slow
decays
down
to
10%
over
the
duration.
Additional
Information:
Xerath
fires
a
orb
of
energy
forward
in
a
line
that
detonates
on
striking
an
enemy,
dealing
magic
damage
and
stunning
them
for
between
0.
and
2
seconds.
The
stun
duration
increases
as
the
orb
travels.
Xerath
anchors
himself
to
his
current
location
for
up
to
10
seconds.
While
anchored,
Xerath
is
immune
to
displacement
effects
and
gains
the
ability
to
cast
Arcane
Barrage
up
to
three
times,
but
cannot
cast
his
other
abilities.
Rite
of
the
Arcane
can
be
cancelled
early
by
moving
or
attacking
and
will
automatically
end
once
Arcane
Barrage
has
been
cast
3
times.
If
Rite
of
the
Arcane
ends
without
using
a
single
cast
of
Arcane
Barrage,
the
cooldown
is
reduced
by
50%.
Interrupting
crowd
control
effects,
with
the
exception
of
displacement
effects,
will
interrupt
Rite
of
the
Arcane
and
put
if
on
full
cooldown.
