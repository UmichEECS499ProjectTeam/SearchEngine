Note

If
they're
stronger,
it
might
be
more

to
stay

counter-harass.
While
Swain
has
extreme
killing
potential,
his
main
counters
lie
in
targets
who
build
large
amounts
of
defence
as
well
as
having
built-in
sustain,
such
as
Cho'Gath
or
Nunu.
Swain's
exorbitant
mana

nearly
be
an
unstoppable
force.
Be
cautious
when
using
to
farm,
as
it
opens
you
up
to
ganks,
as
you
will
have
no
survivability
beyond
trying
to
keep
one
enemy
away
with
Q->W.
While
escaping,
you
can
activate

as
it
will
heal
you
as
your
enemies
pursue
you.
This
can
be
very
effective
because
the
projectiles
prioritizes
champions
and
heals
yourself
75-88%
of
the
damage
dealt
to
them.
Healing
with
your
ultimate
while
throwing
down
your
slow
and
snare
gives
Swain
an
easy
escape.
The
best
combo
for

,
,

This
combo
is
especially
effective
against
melee
champions
near
creeps,
because
you
gain
health
from
the
creeps
while
you
engage
the
enemy
champion.
This
drains
your
more
quickly
than
almost
any
champion,
however,
so
make
sure
to
buy
some
mana
items
to
fuel
your
combo.
If

doing
well,
giving
him
can
greatly
increase
his
effectiveness,
and
even
if
he
is
doing
poorly,
the
buff
could
allow
him
to
make
a
comeback
or
at
least
get
back
on
level
ground
with
his
team
and
the
opposition.
With

the
control

have

inherently
more
important
and
useful.
This
is
because
almost
all
physical
damage
is
done
over
time,
which
your
healing
counters,
and
most
of
the
significant
physical
damage
is
put
off
by
squishy
carries,
who
are
almost
free
food
to
your
combo.
If
you
activated
when
engaging
an
enemy
remember
to
stop
the
spell
if
the
enemy
champion
escapes
out
of
your
range,
if
not
you
could
not
have
enough
mana
left
to
use
your
spells
when
you
reach

resulting
in
a
counterattack,
being
ganked,
or
allowing
the
enemy
to

A
good
harass
method
is
launching
immediately
after

then
approach
and

some
autoattacks
before
retreating,
this
combo
should
deal
around

vulnerable
to
a
final
combo
of
your
abilities.

With

by

After

This
