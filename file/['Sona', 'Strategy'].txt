very
strong
if

up
quickly.
However,
because
of
her
lack
of
escape
mechanisms
or
survivability
skills,
she
should
still
be
played
as
a
support
champion.
In
a
passive
support
lane,
encourage
your
carry
to
trade
blows
with
the
opponent,
and
do
the
same
with

Afterwards,
heal
yourself
and
your
partner
with

This
will
wear
down
the
enemy
and
force
them
out
of

in
less
time
and
mana
than
just
poking
with

advantage
of
it,
and
lets
the
entire
team

Without
a
teammate
around,
is
little
more
than
an
easy
gank.
Early
game,
be
wary
of
constant
spell
rotation,
as
it
will
quickly
drain
her
mana.
However,
this
can
also
be
a
large
problem
mid
to
late
game
without
proper
itemization.

with
allies'
channeled
abilities

devastate
the
opposing
team,
as
while
stunned,
they
can't
interrupt
the
channel.
Being
a
support,
should
focus
on
supporting
her
AD
carry
early
game
by
warding
and
keeping
him/her
safe.
If
your
carry
can
get
last
hits,
you'll
want
to
leave
them
for
him/her.
You
can
offset
your
lack
of
farm
by
buying
or
for
more
sustain,
better
healing,
and
Gp10.
If
you
go
midlane,
you
usualy
need
to
keep
your
wards
up,
as
chance
to
escape
ganks,
when
not
warded,
is
limited,
and
basicaly
impossible
if
your
flash
is
down.
Getting
fast
is
recomended,
as
well
as
getting
right
afterwards.
You
also
want
to
rotate
your
abilities,
in
order
to
have

stacks

your
passive

A

all
it
takes
is
Sona's
presence
for
her
to
be

and
most
of
the

you
should
be
getting

relatively
cheap.
All

Because
Sona
has
generally
low
,
low
costs,
and
needs
to
constantly
switch
abilities,
she
charges
up
faster
than
almost
any
other
champion.
This
also
helps
her,

it
