Vel'Koz
the
Eye
of
the
Void
or
Release
date
Vel'Koz's
damaging
abilities
apply
stacks
of
Deconstruction
for
7
seconds,
stacking
up
to
3
times.
Upon
reaching
3
stacks,
the
stacks
detonate
and
the
target
suffers
25
+
(10
Ã—
level)
true
damage.
Basic
attacks
will
refresh
the
duration,
but
will
not
add
additional
stacks.
Vel'Koz
fires
a
bolt
of
energy
that
deals
magic
damage
and
slows
the
first
enemy
hit
by
70%
for
a
few
seconds.
The
slow
decays
over
the
duration.
Upon
hitting
an
enemy,
reaching
maximum
range
or
being
reactivated,
the
bolt
splits
in
two:
each
traveling
in
opposite
directions
perpendicular
to
the
direction
of
cast.
Each
of
the
secondary
bolts
deal
magic
damage
and
slow
the
first
enemies
they
hit,
respectively.
Additional
Information:
Vel'Koz
stores
a
charge
of
Void
Rift
every
few
seconds
and
can
store
up
to
2
charges.
The
recharge
time
is
affected
by
cooldown
reduction.
Vel'Koz
opens
a
rift
to
the
void
that
cuts
through
the
ground
in
a
line,
dealing
magic
damage
and
leaving
behind
a
trail.
,
the
entire
trail
detonates,
dealing
magic
damage
to
enemies
standing
upon
it.
Additional
Information:
Vel'Koz
hurls
an
anomaly
at
the
target
location.
When
it
lands,
it
collapses,
dealing
magic
damage
and
suspending
enemies
hit
for
0.
seconds.
Enemies
close
to
Vel'Koz
at
the
time
of
impact
are
also
slightly
knocked
back.
Additional
Information:
Vel'Koz
roots
himself
in
place
and
unleashes
a
laser
forward
in
a
line,
damaging
all
enemies
caught
in
its
wake
at
0.
second
intervals
and
slowing
them
by
20%
for
1
second.
The
ray's
trajectory
will
update
over
the
duration
to
face
the
cursor
and
will
end
after
either
2.
seconds
have
elapsed
or
Vel'Koz
recasts
the
ability.
Organic
Deconstruction
can
not
be
applied
more
frequently
than
once
every
0.
seconds.
