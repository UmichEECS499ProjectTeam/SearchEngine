Before
Nocturne,
people
believed
that
dreams
were
figments
of
their
imaginations,
meaningless
images
that
flashed
through
the
mind
when
one
slept.
This
belief
was
put
to
the
test
when
a
rash
of
sleep-related
incidents
started
afflicting
of
the
.
Some
would
wake
up
screaming,
terrified
and
beyond
consolation.
Some
could
not
fall
asleep,
slowly
going
mad
as
the
nights
ticked
by.
Some
simply
never
woke
up.
Physicians
were
baffled
until
a
Architect
happened
to
pass
out
next
to
a
on
the
.
Witnesses
said
he
cried
out
once
and
then
stopped
breathing.
Immediately
after,
magical
energy
arced
out
from
the
nexus,
and
Nocturne
appeared.
Nocturne
did
not
take
his
introduction
to
this
world
kindly.
He
slaughtered
everything
he
could
find
before
summoners
were
able
to
magically
confine
him.
After
a
period
of
intense
study,
League
experts
divined
that
Nocturne
hunted
summoners
in
their
sleep,
attacking
them
in
a
place
where
their
magic
was
useless.
This
seemed
to
be
his
only
purpose.
The
families
of
the
victims
demanded
justice,
but
League
officials
were
concerned
that
death
might
only
return
Nocturne
to
the
place
from
which
he
came.
They
bound
him
to
a
nexus
fragment,
trapping
him
in
the
physical
world.
As
punishment
for
his
crimes,
they
allowed
summoners
to
call
upon
Nocturne
in
League
matches,
bending
his
will
to
the
summoners
he
hates
and
creating
his
own
personal
nightmare.
League
scholars
don’t
know
whether
he
truly
came
from
the
plane
of
dreams,
or
whether
there
are
any
more
like
him.
Some
theorize
that
the
summoning
act
affected
the
summoners'
subconscious
minds,
luring
Nocturne
to
them
in
their
sleep.
Perhaps
the
most
disturbing
theory
is
that
Nocturne
is
a
person’s
nightmare
come
to
life.
If
this
is
true,
they
wonder,
who
is
the
dreamer?
