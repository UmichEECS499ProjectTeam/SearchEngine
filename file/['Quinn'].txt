Quinn
Demacia's
Wings
or
Release
date
Valor
periodically
marks
a
nearby
enemy
with
Vulnerability
for
4.
seconds.
If
Quinn
attacks
a
Vulnerable
enemy,
she
deals
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
/
bonus
physical
damage.
This
cannot
occur
again
for
10
seconds,
or
3
seconds
if
Quinn
triggers
the
vulnerability.
Valor
will
first
prioritize
Quinn's
most
recent
attack
target.
If
Quinn
has
not
attacked
anyone
recently,
Valor
will
target
nearby
low
health
units
(prioritizing
champions
over
minions).
Harrier
is
disabled
while
Tag
Team
is
active.
Additional
Information:
Quinn
commands
Valor
to
fly
forwards
in
a
line,
stopping
when
he
collides
with
an
enemy.
Valor
then
deals
physical
damage
and
blinds
nearby
enemies
within
210
range
for
1.
seconds.
Valor
deals
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
within
275
range
of
himself
and
blinds
them
for
1.
seconds.
Attacking
a
Vulnerable
target
will
grant
Quinn
bonus
attack
speed
and
flat
movement
speed
for
3
seconds.
Valor
gains
bonus
attack
speed.
All
area
within
range
is
revealed
for
2
seconds.
Quinn
dashes
to
an
enemy,
knocking
it
back
a
short
distance,
dealing
physical
damage
and
slowing
the
target's
movement
speed
by
50%.
This
slow
decays
over
2
seconds.
Upon
reaching
the
target,
she
leaps
off
and
lands
near
her
maximum
attack
range
away
from
the
target.
Valor
will
immediately
mark
this
target
as
Vulnerable.
Valor
dashes
to
an
enemy
and
applies
the
same
slow,
knockback
and
physical
damage,
but
does
not
mark
or
leap
off
the
target.
Additional
Information:
For
20
seconds,
Valor
replaces
Quinn
on
the
battlefield
as
a
mobile
melee
attacker
with
alternate
versions
of
Quinn's
abilities.
Valor
can
move
through
units
and
gains
greatly
increased
movement
speed
that
gradually
decreases
to
a
lower
amount
while
in
combat.
Quinn
returns
to
perform
Skystrike,
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
within
range.
The
damage
increases
by
1%
for
every
1%
of
an
enemy's
missing
health.
If
Skystrike
has
not
been
cast
during
Tag
Team,
it
will
be
cast
automatically
when
Tag
Team
ends.
