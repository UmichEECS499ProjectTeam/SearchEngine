If
such
tales
are
true,
then
the
rumors
that
follow
must
be
equally
true
-
that
one
day,
the
Voidborn
will
return.
Even
now,
something
dark
stirs
in
,
perverting
the
summoning
rituals
of
to
allow
the
presence
of
Cho'Gath.
It
is
an
alien
creature
of
malice
and
violence,
a
thing
that
causes
all
but
the
most
stalwart
to
cringe
in
fear.
Cho'Gath
even
appears
to
feed
on
its
predations,
growing
and
swelling
as
it
gorges
itself.
Worse
yet,
the
creature
is
intelligent,
perhaps
greatly
so,
making
most
wonder
how
such
a
monster
could
be
contained.
Fortunately,
the
power
of
the
League's
summoning
has
confined
Cho'Gath's
presence
exclusively
to
the
League
of
Legends.
It
is
here
that
summoners
use
Cho'Gath's
Voidborn
abilities
to
help
decide
the
fate
of
Runeterra.
The
Terror
of
the
Void
knows
what
fate
it
would
choose
for
Runeterra,
given
half
the
chance.

There
is
a
place
between
dimensions,
between
worlds.
To
some
it
is
known
as
the
Outside,
to
others
it
is
the
Unknown.
To
those
that
truly
know,
however,
it
is
called
.
Despite
its
name,
the
Void
is
not
an
empty
place,
but
rather
the
home
of
unspeakable
things
-
horrors
not
meant
for
minds
of
men.
Cho'Gath
is
a
creature
born
of
the
Void,
a
thing
whose
true
nature
is
so
awful
most
will
not
speak
its
name.
Its
fellows
have
been
poking
at
the
walls
that
divide
dimensions
for
a
crack,
a
way
into
,
where
they
can
visit
their
own
personal
paradise
of
horror
upon
the
world.
They
are
called
the
Voidborn,
creatures
so
ancient
and
terrible
that
they
have
been
removed
from
history
altogether.
It
is
rumored
that
the
Voidborn
command
vast
armies
of
unspeakable
creatures
on
other
worlds,
that
they
were
once
driven
from
Runeterra
by
powerful
magic
lost
to
antiquity.

Woe
betides
the
day
when
Cho'Gath
grows
weary
of
the
League.
"You'd
wish
the
world
you
know
to
end!
Yeeeesssss..."
"You
have
stains
upon
your
soul...
Perfect."
"Who
will
be
eaten
first?"
"Your
souls
will
feed
the
Void!"
"There
will
be
no
end
to
your
suffering!"
"You
shall
not
escape!"
"You
are
such...
hideous
creatures!"
"No!
I
do
not
live
under

Fool!"
"The
daylight!
It
burns!"
"For
the
darkness!"
"Summoner,
your
darkness
beckons."
"Afraid
of
the
dark...?
Wise!"

races
are
a
scourge
upon
the
world!"
"I
shall
bring
them
terror!"
"You...
are
a
scourge
upon
the
world."
"Death
is
not
the
end
for
you.
I
have
seen
to
it.
For

you
are

you

he
fights!"

Death?"

This

has

stomping
through
nearby
cities

crushing
anyone
and
everything
in

construct
to
crush

This

of
the
Terror
of
the

comes
to
the
fight
as
a
mechanical
menace,
firing
missile
