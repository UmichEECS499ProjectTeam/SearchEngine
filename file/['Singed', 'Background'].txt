When
the
uneasy
peace
created
by
settled
on
the
world,
Singed
journeyed
to
the
one
place
where
he
was
still
able
to
showcase
his
beloved
craft:
the
.
By
this
time
he
was
barely
even
a
man,
his
body
both
ruined
and
sustained
by
his
ingenious
craft.
A
thousand
burns
–
accidents
of
shadow
and
flame
–
mark
his
ravaged
form,
and
exposure
to
such
harsh
conditions
has
deadened
his
nerves,
hardened
his
body,
and
strengthened
his
physique,
transforming
him
into
a
veritable
juggernaut.
This,
combined
with
a
formidable
arsenal
of
deadly
concoctions,
make
Singed
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
on

Singed
descended
from
a
long
line
of
's
revered
chemists.
Even
in
his
youth,
his
talent
for
concocting
potions
far
outstripped
that
of
his
peers,
and
he
quickly
distinguished
himself
from
his
less
extraordinary
chemist
compatriots.
It
came
as
no
surprise
to
anyone
when
he
was
selected
for
apprenticeship
by
the
infamous
,
master
apothecary
on
a
lucrative
retainer
with
the
military
during
their
campaign
against
.
Within
Warwick's
laboratories,
Singed
toiled
without
end,
rapidly
absorbing
every
detail
of
his
predecessor's
deadly
craft.
Singed
had
little
concern
for
the
death
and
destruction
that
was
the
fruit
of
his
labors.
By
the
time
the
curse
of
lycanthropy
descended
to
claim
his
master,
Singed
was
poised
and
eager
to
make
the
transition
from
workhorse
to
innovator;
he
was
ready
to
share
his
genius
by
bringing
a
new
brand
of
suffering
to
the
Ionian
front.
His
zeal
for
progress
was
unquenchable,
and
when
suitable
test
subjects
proved
to
be
in
short
supply,
the
eager
chemist
was
often
thought
to
turn
his
volatile
mixtures
on
his
own
flesh.
