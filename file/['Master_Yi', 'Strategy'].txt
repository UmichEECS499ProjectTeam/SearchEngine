to

could
be
used
again
upon
a
kill
that
caused

However,
this
type

Yi
his
original
DPS
qualities,
with
him
solely
relying
on
his

get

to

output.
Also
as
of
the
rework,

only

making

builds
highly
ineffective.
Theoretically,
before
the

it
was
possible
to
build
as
a
hybrid
ADAP
champion;
due
to
the

bonus
from

he
had
enough

spare

with
the
proper
high-AD
items
(including

and
with
high/decent
AP
as
well.
Thus,
Yi
could
make
full
use
of
his
kit
with
items
like

As
of
the
rework,
items
that
offer
Yi
high
attack
mixed
with
some
items
that
provide
moderate
AP
can
work
to
make
Yi
heal
more
than
usual
without
losing
his
DPS/assassin-style
kill
potential.
With
the
aforementioned
