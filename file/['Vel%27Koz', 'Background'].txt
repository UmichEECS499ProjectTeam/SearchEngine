I
pass
into
the
sudden
glare.
Blink.
Blink,
blink,
blink.
My
eyes
adjust
and
evaluate
the
landscape
before
me.
There's
a
scurrying.
I
look
down
to
find
a
small,
white
creature
standing
on
its
hind
legs,
sniffing
at
my
body.
It
intrigues
me.
What
use
are
you?
I
analyze
the
creature.
A
flash
of
hot
magenta
light,
a
dust
pile
where
it
was
quivering.
Mammalian...
nocturnal...
impeccable
hearing.
Incredibly
weak.
Yet
they
breed
so
prodigiously.
"Hm,"
I
mutter
to
myself.
Hopefully
there
will
be
more
complex
things
to
be
found;
those
fascinate
me.
Consume
and
learn:
this
is
my
purpose.
The
others
who
travel
with
me
are
primitive:
kill
and
eat,
kill
and
eat.
I
need
to
gather
all
available
information
-
harvest
any
valuable
resources.
Eventually,
we
come
upon
a
.
It
appears
to
be
protected
-
or
intentionally
left
standing.
I
deconstruct
the
composition
of
the
ruins.
My
analysis
suggests
this
habitat
was
a
place
of
great
magic;
I'm
not
surprised
it
was
a
target
of
such
destruction.
There
is
something
compelling
about
the
tower.
While
the
others
are
off
scavenging,
I
enter
the
citadel.
Cryptic
instruments
are
strewn
about.
I
examine
one.
Another
flash
of
hot
magenta
light,
another
dust
pile.
Fascinating:
a
tool
to
alter
their
concept
of
time.
Strange.
Unprecedented.
From
the
state
of
the
tower,
it
seems
the
departed
only
recently.
The
artifacts
left
behind
have
existed
in
more
than
one
time
and
place.
Some
are
more
complex
than
others;
all
are
more
impressive
than
anything
I
have
seen
on
this
plane.
Clearly,
the
owner
knows
things
I
have
not
encountered
in
any
of
my
travels.
I
require
such
knowledge.
Leaving
the
tower,
I
find
the
others
closing
in
on
the
entrance,
ready
to
destroy
it
as
they
have
destroyed
everything
else
we
have
met.
They
will
only
get
in
the
way
of
my
goal.
There
are
some
things
the
Void
should
not
consume
indiscriminately.
Without
warning,
I
lash
out
a
tentacle,
its
tip
glowing
white
hot.
Lightning
arcs
through
the
first
creature,
knocking
it
back.
Its
screams
fade
as
I
extend
all
three
limbs,
energy
crackling
between
them,
scorching
the
air
where
the
streams
meet.
The
other
two
run;
they
know
what's
coming.
Must
they
always
flee?
I
open
my
eye
wide
and
unleash
a
beam
of
energy,following
the
escaping
creatures.
They
are
instantly
reduced
to
ash.
"Hmm.
Void-native
melting
point
is
inconsistent,"
I
note.
But
that
is
of
no
consequence.
The
hunger
inside
me
grows.
I
am
ravenous.
Insatiable,
as
never
before.
I
have
glimpsed
the
ultimate
knowledge.
And
I
will
have
it.

You

Thank

"Knowledge
through...
disintegration."
"High

fascinating
evolution."
"Hm...
extraordinary."
"Odd
creatures
of
blood

is
much
to
learn
about
this
world."
"Humans:
simple,
messy,
yet
exceptional."
"That's
unexpected."

miss
the
darkness
of
the

appendages
seem
redundant."

creatures
really
can
be
repulsive."
"What
secrets
are
you
hiding?"
"I
must
know
more."
"Let's
see
what
they're
made
of."

obscene."
