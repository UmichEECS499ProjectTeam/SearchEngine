Centuries
ago,
there
lived
a
race
of
creatures
as
ferocious
as
they
were
wise.
The
brackern
were
unusual
beings
blessed
with
the
earth's
primal
magic,
embodied
in
the
form
of
crystals.
Their
kind
knew
of
an
arcane
ritual
to
bind
their
life's
essence
to
a
crystal,
communing
with
the
magic
embedded
in
it.
With
this
power,
the
brackern
thrived
in
the
Odyn
Valley,
protecting
both
creatures
and
crystals
alike.
Despite
attacks
from
those
looking
to
claim
the
primal
magic,
it
seemed
that
nothing
could
get
past
the
brackern's
defenses.
Nothing,
that
is,
until
the
devastation
of
a
Rune
War.
A
vicious
battle
was
fought
near
the
Odyn
Valley
and
the
unleashed
chaotic
magic
poisoned
the
crystals.
The
brackern
began
to
grow
sick
and
die,
and
no
amount
of
defensive
magic
could
reverse
the
effects.
To
avoid
extinction,
their
only
course
was
to
hibernate
underground
until
the
wars
stopped.
The
strongest,
most
intelligent
brackern
hibernated
closer
to
the
surface
to
awaken
first
and
assess
the
world's
condition
for
the
return
of
their
race.
The
recent
mining
operations
and
violent
escalation
in
were
enough
to
awaken
the
first
of
these
vanguards.
When
Skarner
burst
to
the
surface,
he
lashed
out
in
anger
and
confusion.
Reason
eventually
won
out
over
his
anger
when
he
realized
that
the
agents
of
who
found
him
were
simply
functionaries.
Skarner
was
invited
to
to
share
the
brackern's
story.
In
return,
the
told
him
about
the
history
that
his
kind
had
slept
through.
Much
had
been
done
to
curb
the
unchecked
use
of
magic
since
the
Rune
Wars,
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
world
was
not
yet
safe
for
his
kind
to
reawaken.
For
now,
however,
there
is
a
place
where
Skarner
can
use
his
power
to
change
the
world
into
one
to
which
his
kind
could
eventually
return:
the
League
of
Legends.

Skarner
was
designed
by
While
designing
a
champion
for
League
of
Legends,
it's
important
to
ensure
that
your
concept
appeals
to
a
broad
audience.
For
instance,
if
you're
out
to
strike
a
chord
with
the
monster
enthusiasts,
amateur
arachnologists,
and
horror
movie
buffs,
it's
good
to
also
incorporate
something
for
those
of
a
more
refined
mindset.
And
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
multifaceted
design,
allow
me
to
introduce
Skarner,
the
Crystal
Vanguard.
One
part
monster,
one
part
crystal,
Skarner
is
sure
to
please
whether
you're
wearing
a
button
up
or
wielding
a
butcher
knife.
Of
course,
if
you're
having
trouble
persuading
everyone
to
agree,
keeping
a
gigantic
scorpion
waiting
in
the
wings
to
menace
them
with
the
threat
of
impalement
on
its
massive
tail
isn't
a
bad
backup
plan.
Greetings
Summoners!
Today,
I
wanted
to
give
a
little
sneak
peek
into
the
gameplay
behind
Skarner,
the
Crystal
Vanguard.
The
idea
behind
Skarner
is
to
get
on
people,
stay
on
them,
and
really
capture
that
inevitability
of
being
run
down
by
a
predatory
creature.
Additionally,
we
wanted
to
avoid
an
instant
gap
closing
mechanic
so
there's
appropriate
counter-play.
The
primary
way
Skarner
accomplishes
this
mission
is
through
his
ability
Crystal
Slash
and
his
passive,
Energize.
Crystal
Slash
does
a
quick,
point-blank
AOE
and
empowers
the
ability
if
it
hits.
Empowered
casts
will
do
bonus
damage
and
slow
(making
successive
uses
really
useful
for
sticking
to
his
target).
His
passive
causes
his
spells
to
cool
down
faster
each
time
he
auto-attacks
-
a
natural
combination
with
the
empowered
Crystal
Slash.
Properly
utilizing
Skarner's
passive
is
central
to
his
gameplay
as
a
whole.
For
example,
Skarner's
ability
Crystalline
Exoskeleton
puts
up
a
shield
that
grants
additional
movement
and
attack
speed
while
it's
up.
The
bonus
attack
speed
will
help
greatly
decrease
the
cooldown
time
of
his
abilities,
leading
to
additional
Crystal
Slashes
or
more
uptime
on
this
steroid.
Skarner's
marquee
ability
is
Impale.
This
ultimate
causes
him
to
skewer
an
opponent
with
his
tail
and
drag
them
around
for
a
few
seconds.
The
positional
manipulation
of
the
ability
can
turn
a
teamfight
by
peeling
an
enemy
off
of
a
wounded
ally,
or
dragging
a
greedy
enemy
into
a
tower.
Players
have
been
asking
for
another
monster
champion
for
a
while,
so
we're
happy
to
deliver
Skarner,
our
own
weaponized
arachnid."
