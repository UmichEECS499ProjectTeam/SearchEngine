Gangplank
was
born
the
son
of
the
dread
pirate
captain
Vincent
the
Shadow
-
one
of
the
most
wealthy
and
feared
pirates
in
all
of
.
One
might
think
this
would
have
spoiled
the
boy
with
a
cushioned
life
of
privilege,
but
the
truth
is
quite
the
opposite.
Growing
up
in
the
city
of
isn't
easy;
pirates
are
not
known
for
their
compassion,
and
that
most
certainly
extends
to
their
families.
Vincent
wanted
his
son
to
grow
up
tough
and
strong,
so
he
was
extremely
hard
on
the
young
Gangplank.
Even
as
a
child,
Gangplank
was
as
mean
as
a
snake
and
is
said
to
have
slept
with
his
eyes
open.
As
he
grew,
the
young
man
rapidly
became
the
most
ruthless
and
feared
pirate
in
all
of
Bilgewater,
and
his
daddy
was
never
more
proud
than
on
the
day
of
his
son's
eighteenth
birthday
-
when
Gangplank
stabbed
his
old
man
in
the
back
and
claimed
the
famed
pirate
ship,
the
Dead
Pool,
for
his
own.
The
continent
of
,
however,
is
a
dangerous
place
for
pirates;
Gangplank
could
read
the
writing
on
the
wall.
The
den
of
pirates
known
as
Bilgewater
would
soon
be
pulled
down
by
the
undertow
of
Valoranian
politics
and
.
It
was
time
for
Bilgewater
to
have
their
own
champion
to
represent
them
in
the
League
of
Legends,
and
who
better
than
the
fiercest
pirate
of
them
all?
It
is
said
that
Gangplank
has
enough
power
and
favor
to
claim
the
title
of
the
Pirate
King
back
home,
but
that
he
is
simply
biding
his
time
and
building
his
reputation
as
a
champion
before
he
returns
to
a
life
of
piracy.

Yo

Or

shoot

when
his
back
is
turned
and
steal
all
his
booty.
"Prepare
to
be
boarded!"
"Yaarr!"
"Swab
the
poop
deck!"
"C'mere,

beauty!
Hehehe."
"Look

trawled
out
of
the
bunghole!"
"Nothin'
but
a
bilge
rat!"
"I'll
be
usin'
ye
for
chum!"
"I
won't
rest
till
I
see
ye
hangin'
from
the

"Ya-ha-har!"
"Avast,

"Shiver
me

"Yo

of...
rum!"
"Ahoy!"
"Well

"I

"Enjoy
your
visit
to
the
depths
of

"Wanna

Heheheh..."

As
part
of
our
continued
commitment
to
keeping
League
of
Legends
a
fun
and
engaging
experience,
we
will
be
updating
yet
another
of
our
classic
champions
with
a
salty
new
model
and
some
truly
seaworthy
new
animations.
Like
Kayle,
Janna,
and
Tryndamere
before
him,
Gangplank,
the
Saltwater
Scourge,
will
be
the
next
champion
of
the
League
to
walk
down
the
plank
(err…
runway!)
sporting
some
knavish
new
looks.
We
think
you’ll
like
the
cut
of
his
jib!
