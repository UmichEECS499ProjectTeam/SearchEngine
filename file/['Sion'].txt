Sion
the
Undead
Champion
or
Release
date
Sion
has
a
40%
chance
to
ignore
up
to
/
/
damage
each
time
he
is
hit
by
a
basic
attack.
The
damage
reduction
is
calculated
before
armor
and
percentage
damage
reduction
benefits
are
taken
into
account.
Sion's
gaze
terrifies
a
single
enemy,
dealing
magic
damage
and
stunning
it
for
1.5
seconds.
Sion
surrounds
himself
with
a
shield
which
absorbs
damage
for
up
to
10
seconds.
After
4
seconds,
if
the
shield
has
not
been
destroyed,
the
ability
can
be
cast
again
to
explode
and
deal
magic
damage
to
surrounding
enemies.
It
will
explode
automatically
after
the
10
seconds
have
passed.
Additional
Information:
While
toggled
on,
Sion
has
increased
attack
damage
at
the
cost
of
some
health
for
each
basic
attack.
While
Enrage
is
active,
Sion
permanently
increases
his
maximum
health
whenever
he
kills
a
unit
with
either
his
attacks
or
abilities.
This
effect
is
doubled
against
champions
and
large
units.
Additional
Information:
For
20
seconds,
Sion
gains
bonus
lifesteal
and
50%
attack
speed.
Additionally,
Sion's
basic
attacks
will
heal
surrounding
allies
for
a
percentage
of
the
damage
dealt.
