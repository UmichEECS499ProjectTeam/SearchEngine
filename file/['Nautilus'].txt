Nautilus
the
Titan
of
the
Depths
or
Release
date
Nautilus's
basic
attacks
deal
an
additional
2
+
(6
Ã—
level)
physical
damage
and
root
his
target
for
/
/
/
/
seconds.
This
effect
cannot
trigger
on
the
same
target
more
than
once
every
12
seconds.
Nautilus
hurls
his
anchor
forward
in
a
line.
If
it
hits
an
enemy
unit,
Nautilus
drags
himself
and
the
unit
together,
dealing
magic
damage
and
briefly
stunning
the
enemy.
If
the
anchor
hits
terrain,
Nautilus
will
drag
himself
forward
and
the
cooldown
is
reduced
by
50%.
Additional
Information:
Nautilus
gains
a
shield
that
absorbs
a
certain
amount
of
damage.
The
shield
dissipates
after
10
seconds
if
not
already
destroyed.
While
the
shield
persists,
Nautilus's
basic
attacks
are
enhanced
to
debuff
all
enemies
within
175
range
of
his
target,
dealing
bonus
magic
damage
over
2
seconds.
Titan's
Wrath
also
resets
Nautilus'
basic
attack
timer
when
first
used.
Additional
Information:
Nautilus
slams
the
ground,
causing
the
earth
to
explode
around
him
in
3
waves.
Each
explosion
deals
magic
damage
to
enemies
in
the
area
and
slows
them
for
2
seconds.
This
slow
diminishes
over
time.
An
enemy
can
be
hit
by
more
than
one
explosion,
but
take
50%
reduced
damage
after
the
first.
Additional
Information:
Nautilus
fires
a
shockwave
that
chases
a
target
enemy
champion,
dealing
magic
damage
and
knocking
up
enemies
it
passes
through.
The
shockwave
explodes
upon
hitting
its
target,
dealing
magic
damage,
knocking
them
up
for
1
second
and
stunning
the
target.
