As
a
young
teen,
Lee
Sin
was
intent
on
becoming
a
.
His
will
and
dedication
were
unmatched
by
any
of
his
peers,
and
his
skill
drew
the
attention
of
Reginald
Ashram,
the
High
Councilor
at
the
time.
While
studying
at
the
Arcanum
Majoris,
Lee
Sin
became
frustrated
with
instruction
paced
for
the
other
students.
He
spent
his
free
time
researching
the
nuances
of
summoning
in
hopes
of
graduating
sooner.
He
made
amazing
advances
in
his
arcane
studies,
surpassing
all
other
students.
By
all
indications,
he
would
have
become
one
of
the
League's
greatest
summoners
were
it
not
for
one
terrible
mistake.
Too
impatient,
he
attempted
to
test
his
ability
by
summoning
a
beast
from
the
Plague
Jungles.
What
he
summoned
instead
was
a
young
boy,
but
not
in
one
piece.
He
barely
had
time
to
look
the
boy
in
what
was
once
his
face
before
the
jumbled
human
mass
fell
lifeless
to
the
floor.
A
League
investigation
later
revealed
that
the
boy's
entire
village
was
obliterated
by
feedback
from
the
ritual.
Lee
Sin's
talents
were
so
promising
that
the
League
was
willing
to
overlook
the
incident,
but
he
could
never
forgive
himself.
He
left
the
Institute
and
journeyed
to
the
Shojin
Monastery
for
eternal
repentance,
swearing
never
to
practice
magic
again.
Years
later,
hoping
to
atone
for
his
crime
with
martyrdom,
he
set
himself
ablaze
as
a
protest
of
the
occupation
of
.
He
remained
alive
in
this
state,
enduring
searing
agony
for
weeks.
His
actions
paved
the
way
for
a
wherein
Ionia
prevailed,
but
by
the
time
he
was
doused,
his
eyes
had
been
burned
completely
from
their
sockets.
Hailed
as
a
savior,
he
was
reborn,
and
his
will
to
act
invigorated.
He
joined
the
League
of
Legends
to
continue
his
atonement
with
sweat
and
blood,
a
true
monk's
only
possessions.
The
events
leading
up
to
the
Ionia
vs
Noxus
rematch
started
when
Lee
Sin,
a
monk
from
the
Shojin
Monastery,
set
himself
aflame
within
the
Ionian
Lotus
Garden.
He
would
not
allow
anyone
to
put
out
the
fire
until
the
three
regions
of
Southern
Ionia
were
freed
from
Noxus'
occupation.
Lee
Sin
remained
in
this
state
of
excruciating
pain
for
over
two
months.
After
Ionia
won
their
rematch
against
Noxus,
he
was
greeted
by
his
sister
from
the
now
liberated
Southern
provinces.
Only
then
did
Lee
Sin
allow
the
flames
to
be
extinguished.
Though
his
brethren
swiftly
brought
the
monk
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment,
he
had
already
suffered
the
loss
of
his
eyes
due
to
the
intense
heat.
His
height
is
similar
to
that
of
,
basing
upon
his
concept
art.
It
was
said
that
he
was
remade
into
.
However,
Riot
Game
Designer
Guinsoo
hinted
that
this
was
not
the
case.
Hohums
later
confirmed
Guinsoo's
words.
It
has
been
implied
that
he
was
the
burning
monk
during
the
Ionia/Noxus
feud,
in
,
stating
"His
brethren
hastened
the
monk’s
blistered
body
swiftly
back
to
the
monastery
for
treatment.
While
it
was
clear
that
he
would
survive,
,
along
with
other
severe
injuries
from
the
intense
heat."
These
would
seem
to
corroborate
the
"Mystic
Meditation"
icon,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
flickers
of
flame
can
be
seen
in
its
portrait.
This
was
later
confirmed
in
his
League
Judgment,
and
Champion
Background.
Lee
Sin
is
a
reference
to
A
who
burned
himself
as
an
act
of
protest
against
the
persecution
of
Buddhist
monks
during
the
in
South
Vietnam.
Ezreal
stated
that
the
blind
monk
has
been
deconfirmed
.
In
Maokai's
Art
Spotlight,
towards
the
end
a
tab
is
shown
titled
"blindmonk.psd",
which
could
mean
that
artwork
is
being
done
for
Lee
Sin,
that
the
Rioters
are
trying
to
tease
the
Blind-Monk
fanboys,
or
that
the
artist
in
question
just
likes
working
on
Blind
Monk
for
fun.
Also,
in
the
video
"Brolaf,
the
King
of
Bromacia"
the
name
"Blind
Monk"
can
be
seen
on
the
New
Champions
Board
.
This
however
was
most
likely
done
as
a
joke
by
the
staff
as
in
the
same
list
there
are
other
champions
Riot
has
long
stated
to
have
ceased
development.
On
March

Lee

was
re-confirmed

can

Interestingly,
in
the

the

can
be
seen
as
well.
On
March
28th,
Lee
Sin's
Champion
Spotlight
came
out
but
it
was
a
troll
video,
furthering
the
belief
that
he
wouldn't
actually
be
released.
However,
the
video
stated
that
he
wouldn't
be
released
with
the
V1.0.0.114
patch,
but
rather
on
April
1st
because
he
had
"not
been
buffed
enough".
On
March
31st,
Lee
Sin's
actual
was
released,
once
again
stating
that
he
would
be
released
on
April
1st.
On
April
1st,
Lee
Sin
was
actually
released
and
became
available
to
buy
in
the
Store.

:
If
there’s
anything
that
the
death
of
Urf
the
Manatee
has
taught
us,
it’s
that
people
deal
with
grief
in
different
ways.
For
instance,
take
this
gentleman
here.
Lee
Sin
was
so
shaken
up
that
he
actually
ran
off
and
joined
a
monastery.
Now
he’s
Lee

Blind
Monk.
Hey,
what
do
you
mean
you’ve
seen
him
before?

It

forward
to
pour
