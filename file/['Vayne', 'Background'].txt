The
world
is
not
always
as
civilized
as
people
might
think.
There
are
still
those
who
would
follow
the
blackest
paths
of
magic
and
become
corrupted
by
the
darker
powers
that
flow
through
.
Shauna
Vayne
knows
this
fact
well.
As
a
young
privileged
girl
in
the
heart
of
's
elite,
her
father
tried
to
convince
her
of
the
constabulary's
ever-vigilant
eye.
Young
and
naive,
she
truly
believed
that
her
world
was
one
of
perfect
safety,
until
one
night,
when
a
twisted
witch
took
interest
in
her
father.
The
malevolent
woman
overcame
her
father's
conciliar
guard,
then
tortured
her
family
before
murdering
them.
The
young
Shauna
escaped
only
by
hiding
herself
and
then
fleeing
once
the
hag
had
departed,
plagued
by
the
screams
of
her
loved
ones
as
she
ran.
A
burning
hatred
was
born
in
her
that
day,
one
that
could
never
be
denied.
Vayne
was
able
to
take
care
of
herself
using
her
father's
money,
and
she
began
to
train
as
soon
as
an
instructor
would
have
her
as
a
student.
By
the
time
she
was
a
fully
grown
woman,
she
had
become
a
grim
warrior.
However,
the
fields
of
battle
were
not
to
be
her
home.
Demacia
needed
a
protector,
one
who
hunted
those
lost
to
the
darkness.
Shauna
used
her
family's
contacts
to
become
the
first
Night
Hunter,
and
now
her
prowess
is
the
stuff
of
legends.
It
is
said
that
those
who
practice
the
black
arts
quake
when
they
hear
that
the
Night
Hunter
is
on
the
prowl.
Despite
her
crusade,
Shauna
has
looked
at
in
horror.
There
are
who
have
clearly
lost
themselves
to
the
blackest
of
magics,
and
who
have
been
embraced
within
the
League
even
though
they
should
be
put
down
for
the
safety
of
all.
The
time
has
come
for
the
Night
Hunter
to
execute
her
secret
mission
-
to
purge
the
League
of
Legends.

If
there’s
anything
that
League
of
Legends
has
taught
us,
it’s
that
not
all
champions
fight
with
swords
and
shields
on
epic
battlefields
alongside
vast
armies.
There
are
those
who
are
capricious
elemental
forces,
others
who
are
powerful
and
scheming
mages,
a
few
who
are
full-fledged
monsters,
and
still
some
who
dart
and
weave
through
dark
city
streets,
silent
vigilantes
on
a
quest
to
rid
the
world
of
vile
villains.
And
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
the
shadowy,
silent
types,
if
you
find
yourself
drawn
to
dark,
dexterous
figures
who
walk
the
fine
line
between
good
and
evil,
you'll
love
Vayne,
the
Night
Hunter.
Just
don't
sneak
up
on
her
in
a
hurry
to
make
an
introduction!
I
hear
that
these
types
can
be
jumpy!
Summoners!

at
your

this

This

we’re
rolling
out
a
brand
new
skin
for
your
favorite
Night
Hunter
that's
sure
to
be
love
at
first
sight.
Feast
