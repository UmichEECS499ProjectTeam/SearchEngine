Thresh
carves
careful,
deliberate
paths
through
.
He
handpicks
his
targets
individually,
devoting
his
full
attention
to
each
soul
in
turn.
He
isolates
and
toys
with
them,
gradually
eroding
their
sanity
with
his
twisted,
maddening
humor.
Once
Thresh
takes
an
interest
in
a
soul,
he
does
not
relent
until
he
possesses
it.
He
then
drags
those
he
captures
back
to
the
for
an
unimaginably
dreadful
fate.
This
is
his
only
purpose.
Little
is
known
about
the
Chain
Warden's
past,
and
many
of
the
details
live
only
in
nursery
rhymes
and
campfire
tales.
They
tell
of
a
sadistic
jailer
from
centuries
past
who
took
great
delight
in
torturing
his
wards.
Patient
and
brutal,
he
used
a
variety
of
methods
to
break
his
victims'
minds
before
their
bodies
succumbed
to
his
grisly
designs.
Chains
were
the
jailer's
preferred
instruments
of
terror.
Their
shrill
scrape
marked
his
dreadful
approach
and
promised
agony
to
those
he
visited.
His
dark
reign
went
unchallenged
until
his
prisoners
escaped
during
a
massive
riot.
They
overwhelmed
him,
and
without
ceremony
or
remorse,
hanged
him
from
his
own
chains.
Thus
began
the
unlife
of
the
horrible
specter
known
as
Thresh,
or
so
the
tales
go.
Thresh
now
haunts
the
land,
leaving
an
aftermath
of
horror
and
despair.
However,
there
is
a
devious
purpose
behind
his
dark
machinations,
and
the
meager
spirits
of
average
men
are
insufficient.
He
seeks
stronger
souls.
Only
when
he
has
broken
the
wills
of
Valoran's
most
resilient
warriors
will
he
finally
have
what
he
needs.
Thresh
raises
his
and
"drinks"
the
souls
coming
out
of
it.

Valoran
Shadow
Isles
Thresh
is
a
twisted
reaper
whose
hungry
chains
ensnare
the
souls
of
the
living.
A
moment's
hesitation
at
the
sight
of
his
ghostly
visage
and
there
is
no
escape.
He
leaves
in
his
wake
hollow
corpses,
their
souls
ripped
loose
and
trapped
in
the
sickly
green
light
of
his
lantern.
The
Chain
Warden
takes
sadistic
joy
in
tormenting
his
victims,
both
before
and
after
their
deaths.
His
grim
task
is
never
complete,
and
he
stalks
the
land
for
ever
more
resolute
spirits
to
unravel.
"There
are
few
things
as
invigorating
as
taking
a
mind
apart,
piece
by
piece."
―
"What
delightful
agony
we
shall
inflict."
"Writhe,
like
a
worm
on
a
hook."
"Nobody
escapes."
"Death?
No...
nothing
that
simple."
"Come
out
and
play."
"It's
over
when
I
say."
"Lock
'em
up."
"Wretched
mongrels
get
the
leash."
"Any
last
words?"
"Oh,
yes!
It's
about
to
get
much
worse."
"No
one
can
save
them."
"Ah,
the
sweet
tones
of
misery."
"Relax,
just...
let
go."
"Me,
mad?
Haha...
quite
likely."
"Hmm,
whose
mind
shall
we
snap?"
"Poor
lost
souls."
"Oh,
the
eternity
we
shall
spend
together."
"Flesh
is
a
prison."
"What
is
the
worth
of
a
soul?"
"I
am
the
thing
under
the
bed."
"Torment
comes
in
so
many
flavors."
"Screaming
won't
do
you
any
good,
but
it's
music
to
my
ears."
"There
is
life.
There
is
death.
And
then
there
is
me."
"Ever
seen
your
soul?
Would
you
like
to?"
"You're
falling
apart.
What
to
do
with
the
pieces?"
Thresh
laughs.
Thresh
laughs.
Thresh
laughs.
Thresh
laughs.
"Round
we
go!"
"This
way!"
"I
own
you."
"My
house,
my
rules."
"Closing
in..."
"Nowhere
to
hide."
"Hook,
line
and
sinker!"
"Going
somewhere?
"Come
back!"
The
newest
support
champion
to
join
the
League
is
Thresh,
the
Chain
Warden.
This
gruesome
specter
wields
wicked,
articulated
chains,
and
specializes
in
harassing
and
disrupting
opposing
teams.
His
collection
of
crowd
control
effects
thwarts
enemy
plans,
while
harvesting
souls
allows
Thresh
to
grow
in
power.
In
game,
Thresh
is
a
support
that
thrives
on
communication
and
cooperation.
He
controls
fights
by
displacing
enemies
and
repositioning
allies.
During
the
laning
phase,
Thresh
uses
the
range
of
his
basic
attack
to
terrorize
opposing
champions
with
his
Death
Sentence
passive.
He
shields
his
lane
partner
with
Dark
Passage
and
–
with
well-executed
positioning
–
offers
them
the
unique
benefit
of
the
lantern's
escape
potential.
Flay's
versatility
lets
Thresh
push
enemies
into
range
for
further
harassment
or
swat
them
away
to
protect
an
ally.
In
the
mid
game,
the
synergy
between
Thresh's
abilities
shines.
An
opportune
lantern
can
bring
a
teammate
along
for
the
ride
when
Thresh
hooks
an
enemy
with
Death
Sentence.
Flay
can
chain
into
a
mid-range
Death
Sentence
to
knock
an
opponent
up
and
grab
them
out
of
the
air.
Thresh
can
put
enemies
in
an
even
scarier
situation
by
isolating
them
in
The
Box
or
can
cast
The
Box
and
then
drag
or
knock
enemies
into
it
to
trigger
the
damage
and
massive
slow
from
breaking
its
spectral
walls.
Because
Thresh
scales
through
collecting
souls
for
Damnation,
an
effective
soul
harvester
will
become
a
potent
damage-soaking
tank
during
the
transition
to
late
game.
In
team
fights,
Thresh
frustrates
enemy
positioning
with
Flay
and
Death
Sentence,
while
shielding
allies
with
Dark
Passage.
The
Box
can
inflict
heavy
burst
damage
and
split
enemy
teams
as
they
try
to
disengage.
Optimize
Thresh
by
collecting
souls
and
protecting
your
allies
before
wreaking
havoc
in
team
fights.
Your
opponents
better
listen
carefully
for
the
scraping
sound
of
his
encroaching
chain,
or
it
may
be
the
last
sound
they
hear!
