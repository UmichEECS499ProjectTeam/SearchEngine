Every
city
has
its
dark
side,
even
one
whose
reputation
is
already
of
a
questionable
hue.
-
though
its
name
is
already
invoked
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
revulsion
-
is
no
exception
to
this
simple
truth.
Deep
within
the
winding
dungeons
that
honeycomb
the
earth
beneath
its
dark,
meandering
streets
lies
the
real
underbelly
of
this
sprawling
metropolis,
a
haven
for
all
manner
of
malevolence.
Amongst
the
cults,
covens,
and
secret
societies
that
call
this
labyrinth
their
home,
LeBlanc,
the
Deceiver,
presides
over
the
Black
Rose,
a
remnant
from
a
lost,
yet
similarly
unscrupulous
time
in
Noxian
history.
Ruthless
and
seemingly
ageless,
LeBlanc
and
her
ilk
were
a
mainstay
in
Noxian
political
affairs
during
the
era
before
the
militarization
of
the
Noxian
government.
In
those
days,
this
guild
of
powerful
magicians
met
in
secret
to
further
their
hidden
agenda,
and
to
hone
a
craft
more
subtle
than
that
preferred
by
those
currently
in
power.
While
their
exact
motives
have
always
remained
mysterious,
it
was
widely
believed
that
the
Black
Rose
was
the
true
power
behind
the
throne
while
the
aristocracy
still
reigned
in
Noxus.
When
raw
martial
prowess
became
the
ultimate
determination
of
whose
will
held
sway
in
the
Empire,
the
Black
Rose
seemed
to
vanish
overnight.
Many
believed
that
perhaps
their
time
had
simply
passed,
and
that
its
members
had
put
aside
their
quests
for
social
and
political
dominance.
When
LeBlanc
reemerged
at
the
gates
of
,
however,
it
became
clear
that
these
masters
of
shadow
and
flame
had
simply
been
biding
their
time,
waiting
for
a
new
global
authority
to
emerge:
