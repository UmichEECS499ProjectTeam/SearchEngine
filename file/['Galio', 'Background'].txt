Long
before
the
regulation
of
such
magic,
mages
experimented
with
the
creation
of
artificial
life.
Now
forbidden,
instilling
golems
with
reason
was
once
not
so
uncommon
a
practice
amongst
the
more
expert
of
craftsmen.
One
such
visionary
was
the
artificer,
Durand.
Peerless
at
crafting
sentient
beings,
Durand's
constructs
served
as
tireless
guardians
for
the
border
towns
of
his
beloved
city-state,
affording
them
protection
from
their
neighbors.
For
his
own
defense,
however,
Durand
kept
his
magnum
opus:
Galio.
This
mighty
construct
forged
in
the
image
of
a
gargoyle
kept
him
safe
on
his
journeys,
allowing
him
to
perform
his
important
work
without
fear
of
reprisal
from
those
hostile
to
his
homeland.
That
is,
until
dealing
with
his
taxing
sentinels
finally
roused
the
ire
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
As
Durand
crossed
the
with
his
masterwork
in
tow,
he
was
set
upon
by
Noxian
assassins
in
force.
Outnumbered
and
overwhelmed,
Galio
looked
on
in
horror
as
the
murderers
cut
down
his
charge,
executing
him
swiftly
before
vanishing
back
into
the
mists.
Stripped
of
his
reason
for
being,
Galio
despaired.
For
years
he
remained
in
solitude,
standing
vigil
over
the
bones
of
the
master
he
had
failed
to
protect...
a
literal
monument
to
his
own
everlasting
shame.
Then,
on
one
nondescript
day,
a
sad
but
determined
carrying
a
mighty
crown
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
statue
to
rest.
Hidden
in
plain
sight
from
his
unsuspecting
visitor,
Galio
studied
the
forlorn
yordle.
She
looked
as
though
she
too
shouldered
a
tremendous
burden.
As
quietly
and
as
stoically
as
she
had
arrived,
she
departed
in
the
direction
of
Demacia.
This
encounter
lit
a
spark
in
Galio's
eye.
Remembering
the
cause
that
his
master
had
died
defending,
Galio
arose
from
his
silent
purgatory
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
this
brave
creature.
He
had
a
new
reason
to
live:
to
join
and
fight
for
the
will
of
Demacia.

Was
this
still
the
Judgment?
Galio
was
designed
by
.
With
this
next
champion
we
had
a
couple
of
goals
in
mind.
For
starters,
we
wanted
to
show
our
continued
commitment
to
the
monster
enthusiasts
by
bringing
those
monstrous
champions
into
the
lineup.
On
the
other
hand,
we
wanted
to
appeal
to
those
sensitive
types
who
don't
identify
with
anything
that's
capable
of
,
,
or
.
We
know
that
it's
a
pretty
tall
order,
but
we're
pretty
sure
that
Galio,
the
Sentinel's
Sorrow,
should
just
be
able
to
bridge
that
gap.
If
you're
a
fan
of
monsters,
just
imagine
a
swooping,
deadly
predator
perched
on
the
edge
of
a
building,
waiting
patiently
to
strike.
And
if
you're
one
of
those
artsy
types
who
doesn't
appreciate
the
grotesque,
well
then,
think
of
him
as
a
piece
of
elegant
statuary.
Summoners!
Sometimes
your
travels
around
the
world
of
Valoran
are
going
to
take
you
on
the
road
to
some
exotic
locales.
If
you
stumble
upon
this
menacing,
red
version
of
Galio
in
your
travels,
however,
the
odds
are
good
that
you’ve
taken
a
wrong
turn
–
especially
if
he's
perched
on
top
of
a
massive,
terrifying
gate
that’s
emanating
an
eerie
green
glow.
Then
you
might
want
to
consult
your
cartographer
to
find
out
why
he
plotted
you
a
course
to
the
gates
of
the
underworld
before
you
set
off.
Of
course,
with
the
Legendary
Gatekeeper
Galio
standing
watch,
you
might
just
want
to
be
grateful
you’re
not
trapped
on
the
other
side.
