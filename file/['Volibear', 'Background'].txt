The
two
awesome
elements
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case
are,
of
course:
bears
and
gigantic
suits
of
armor.
For
many
of
you,
Volibear,
the
Thunder’s
Roar
is
no
doubt
the
best
news
you
will
get
in
the
time
of
your
natural
lives.
For
others,
we
understand
the
anxiety
that
might
accompany
the
thought
of
facing
down
a
massive,
armored
bear.
If
you’re
one
of
those
summoners
afflicted
by
a
phobia
of
bear
armory,
we’ve
arranged
to
include
the
following
comic
to
help
you
face
down
your
fears.
Ursine
enthusiasts
everywhere
rejoice!
Your
bear
in
shining
armor
has
nearly
arrived!

"The
Ursine
cannot
know
peace
without
war."
―
"Few
can
weather
the
storm
that
follows
in
the
wake
of
Volibear's
roar."
―
"Let
the
storm
follow
in
my
wake."
"By
Freljord's
might."
"I
do
not
pity
cowards."
"Sniveling
cubs!"
"Let
none
survive."
"Tremble
at
my
roar!"
"Is
that
a
challenge?"
"To
war!"
"Let
the
storm
follow
in
my
wake."
"The
thunder
calls."
"So
it
shall
be."
"Battle
is
in
my
blood."
"Trust
your
instincts."
"As
fate
decrees."
"Strength
and
wisdom
guide
me."
"The
Ursine
do
not
know
fear."
"A
fool
and
his
head
are
easily
parted."
"Hmm,
I
suppose
you're
expecting
some
unbearable
pun."
Volibear
laughs.
Volibear
laughs.
Volibear
laughs.
Volibear
laughs.
"Face
the
storm!"
"I
have
a
special
claw
for
you,
Zilean."
"Your
time
has
run
out,
Chronokeeper."
Every
once
in
a
while,
there
comes
a
champion
so
controversial
that
even
the
executives
can’t
agree
on
what
to
do
with
them.
Some
might
claim
that
the
combination
of
two
awesome
elements
can
only
yield
up
an
even
greater
awesome
of
truly
epic
proportions,
while
others
might
cling
to
the
superstition
that
too
much
awesome
isolated
in
one
particular
being
can
only
lead
inevitably
to
disaster.
