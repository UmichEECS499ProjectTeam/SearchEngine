Building

can
solidify

dominance
and
help
you
take

opponent
out

If

you're

will
give
you
some
additional

For
most
AD
champs,
it's
best
to
balance
AD
and
attack
speed,
as
whichever
you
have
less
of
will
boost
your
DPS
more
quickly.
But
with
,
as
with
Master
Yi,
there
is
a
special
reason
that
attack
speed
pays
extra;
The
faster
you
can
attack,
the
more
of
your
enemy's
damage
you
block
with
your
passive.
Double
your
attack
speed
means
double
your
effective
damage
absorption.
For
this
reason:
Because
of
his
extra
benefit
from
Attack
Speed,
if
you
are
building
for
sustain
then

great
potential

But
if
you
are
expecting
to
exploit
his
split
push
superiority,
consider
taking
instead,
because
like
,
it
massively
speeds
wave
clear,
especially
on
a
champ
with
high
attack
speed.
Because
's
passive
makes
both
autoattacks
and
crit
100%
of
the
time
when
an
enemy
is
under
15%
health,
consider
for
its
ability
to
increase
crit
damage
from
200%
to
250%.
Of
course
its
high
Attack
Damage
scales
well
on

abilities,
too.
Investing

help
you
mitigate

Baiting

you
and
having

to

is
likely
to
spell
his
doom
without
the
use
of

spells
to

help
you
defeat

If

it

unlikely
they
will

then
have

normal,
using

have

stunned
nonetheless.
If
you
expect
to
survive
his
initial
burst
damage
after
being
stunned,
save
your
escapes
for

that

of
getting

Of
course,
avoiding
the

may
be
a
larger
concern
-
but
consider
the
possibility.
Try

you

Avoid

if

to
reap
the
full
potential
of
the

(such

as
