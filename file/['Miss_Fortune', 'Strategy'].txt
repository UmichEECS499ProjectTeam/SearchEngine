Given

The

is
another
good
item
if
you
are
focusing
on
sustained
damage,
and
being
particularly
effective
against
high
health
targets.
It's
important
for
to
have
enough
armor
penetration
and
attack
speed
in
order
to
maximize
its
value.

Plus,

benefits

another
good
early
pick,
albeit
not
common
on
Marksmen.
It
helps
by
defending
against

and
preventing
spells

Also,
it
can
be
upgraded
to

providing
even
more
AD.
Large
health
items
like

are
not
considered
optimal
as
they
can
be
easily
countered
by
health
shredding
items.
Furthermore,
the
lack
of
resistances
weakens
the
value
of
raw
health.
Another
unconventional
choice
for
Marksmen
is
.
This
item
should
be
considered
however,
when

enemy
team
has
strong
threats
that
rely
on

as

well
as

increase

other
skills.
It
also
gives
her
more
movement
speed
than
most
other
items,
as
well
as
attack
damage,
ability
power,
health
and
mana.
Not
