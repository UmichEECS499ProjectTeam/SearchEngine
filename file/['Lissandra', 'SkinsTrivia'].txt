by

Lissandra
is
the
very
last
living
,
an
extinct
(well
almost)
race
of
powerful
humanoids
with
several
magical
abilities.
Lissandra's
appearance
is
similar
to
that
of
,
Grand
Cenobite
of
.
Lissandra
does
not
use
her
name
within
the
League
in-story.
To
keep
her
cover
as
Lissandra
in
Freljord
she
is
only
listed
as
"The
Ice
Witch"
in
the
League.
The
Ice
Witch's
original
name
is
Lissandra.
When
taking
over
Queen
Mauvole
she
named
her
successor
Lissandra
so
when
the
Ice
Witch
took
her
identity
she
reclaimed
her
own
name.
Lissandra's
lore
resembles
story
from
Final
Fantasy
VIII
where
she
possesses
different
sorceresses
from
different
time
periods,
deceiving
people
to
achieve
her
goal
of
ruling
the
world
in
all
time
periods.
Her
Ice
Shard
skill
resembles
sorceress
Edea's
Ice
Strike.
Lissandra's
character
shares
a
lot
of
similarities
with
from
,
including
their
eternal
life,
accent,
quotes,
and
ambitions
to
destroy
the
world.
Lissandra
also
slightly
resembles
Flemeth
from
Dragon
Age,
while
Flemeth
possesses
and
takes
over
her
"daughter"
Lissandra
steals
her
successors'
identity
much
like
Flemeth
with
her
daughters.
There's
an
event
between

This
makes
it
a
2nd
event

champion
to

a
monologue

screen,

third

If

30
seconds
later
you
will
hear
a
monologue
by
Lissandra
talking
about
the
Frozen
Watchers,
Serylda
and
Avarosa.
Lissandra
is
blind
in
the
sense
that
her
eyes
do
not
work,
mauled
by
an
prior
to
becoming
Iceborn.
However,

of
sensing
