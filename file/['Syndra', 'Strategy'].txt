It
is
recommended
to
get
one
of
your
spells
to
rank
5
as
quickly
as
possible
to
benefit
from
its
bonus.
It
is
also
recommended
that
smartcasting
is
used
on
all
of
Syndra's
abilities
except
her
ultimate.
This
allows
for
seamless
transition
between
her
abilities
and
faster
combos,
which
is
critical
in
team
fights.
To
get
out
4
bonus
spheres
(the
maximum
possible)
you
need
more
than
30%
cooldown
reduction
and
you
can
do
this
by
using
the
following
combo:
Q,
Q,
W
(targeting
the
first
sphere),
Q,
Q,
followed
immediately
by
.
However,
the
delay
on
her
ultimate
and
the
increased
micro
management
requires
a
higher
level
of
skill
on
an
already
difficult
champion.
For
most
players,
it
may
be
more
efficient
to
try
using
Q
and
E,
Q
again
and
W
on
the
first
dark
sphere,
and
then
use
-
this
sacrifices
one
or
two
dark
spheres
on
her
ultimate
for
a
quicker,
more
reliable
combo.
If
you
notice
your
opponent
is
easily
avoiding
all
your
try
to
become
more
conservative
about
it,
the
low
cooldown
makes
it
tempting
to
use
continuously,
but
pushes

lane
if
you
hit

invites
junglers)

drains
your
mana
quickly.

no
channel
upon

which
means
you
can
cast
it
without
interrupting
your
movement.
Take
this
into
consideration
when
playing
Syndra,
since
it
allows
you
to
kite
and
chase
enemy
champions
easily.
To
maximize
your
chances
of

If
you
are
confident
enough
in
your
own
aiming,
casting
right
after
will
cause
them
to
hit
at
the
same
time;
this
can
save
a
few
seconds

Syndra
is
pretty
fragile.
Syndra's
damage
output
is
reliant
on
a
high
CDR
build
-
it
will
provide
stronger
harass
with
Q

W
combos,
and
being
able
to
maintain
more
dark
spheres
on
the

will
potentially
increase

however

costs
and

be
a
preferable
option
depending
on
