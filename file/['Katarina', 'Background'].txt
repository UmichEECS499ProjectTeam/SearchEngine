Katarina
was
designed
by
,
we’ll
be
overhauling
one
of
our
classic
champions:
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade.
Although
Katarina's
manaless,
cooldown-based
abilities
put
a
unique
spin
on
her
gameplay,
she's
historically
faced
a
number
of
challenges
in
the
very
early
game
and
in
team
fight
situations.
In
this
update,
we’ve
made
a
few
changes
to
her
kit
aimed
at
addressing
these
difficulties,
while
retaining
the
core
elements
that
make
playing
this
Noxian
femme
fatale
a
fun
and
satisfying
experience.
We
also
gave
her
a
complete
visual
upgrade,
including
a
new
model,
animations
and
spell
effects
on
all
of
her
abilities!
The
first
problem
that
Katarina
players
often
faced
was
weak
performance
very
early
on,
primarily
related
to
the
steep
damage
curve
of
her
core
damage
ability,
Bouncing
Blades.
While
Bouncing
Blades
scales
dramatically
as
it
levels
up,
early
on
it
ricochets
only
a
few
times,
dealing
relatively
low
damage.
This
forces
Katarina
players
to
play
conservatively
early
in
the
laning
phase,
encouraging
passive
play
until
Bouncing
Blades
can
be
used
to
harass
effectively.
To
address
this
disparity,
we
normalized
the
damage
inflicted
by
Bouncing
Blades
and
made
it
bounce
the
same
number
of
times
at
every
level
of
the
skill.
In
addition,
each
ricochet
will
now
select
the
nearest
available
target
instead
of
bouncing
randomly.
This
change
should
both
facilitate
interesting
counter-play
for
opponents
and
open
up
new
harassment
opportunities
for
advanced
Katarina
players
who
are
able
to
predict
where
their
daggers
are
going
to
bounce.
In
addition
to
her
early
game
difficulties,
Katarina's
reliance
on
the
massive
damage
potential
of
Death
Lotus
has
always
made
her
a
challenging
champion
to
balance.
A
fully
channeled
ultimate
could
quickly
reduce
a
team
to
ashes,
but
a
well-timed
interrupt
from
a
canny
defender
could
quickly
transform
Katarina
from
a
maelstrom
of
death
into
an
easy
kill.
For
this
reason,
we
decided
to
move
the
healing
debuff
from
Killer
Instincts
onto
Death
Lotus
and
decrease
the
channel
time
slightly.
This
reigned
in
the
overall
damage
numbers
slightly,
replacing
some
of
this
raw
punishment
with
a
bit
of
utility
gave
us
the
opportunity
to
make
remainder
of
Katarina's
kit
more
dangerous.
To
accomplish
this,
we
swapped
Killer
Instincts
for
a
spammable,
area-of-effect
attack
that
grants
Katarina
a
brief
speed
boost
when
it
lands.
This
new
ability,
dubbed
Sinister
Steel,
gives
Katarina
superior
mobility
and
allows
her
to
continue
laying
down
damage
on
multiple
targets
during
a
team
fight
if
Death
Lotus
is
interrupted
by
a
stun
or
knockback.
For
a
little
added
kick,
Bouncing
Blades
will
now
apply
a
debuff
that
is
consumed
to
deal
bonus
damage
when
Katarina
strikes
the
target
with
an
attack
or
ability.
These
changes
should
give
Katarina
the
extra
damage
she
needs
to
play
aggressively
right
out
the
gates
and
the
flexibility
necessary
to
keep
her
damage
potential
high
once
the
team
fights
start.
This
brand
new
take
on
Katarina,
the
Sinister
Blade,
will
be
baring
her
blades
in
an
upcoming
patch.
We
hope
you’re
ready!
