it
is
Vladimir's
most
constant
single
target
damage
ability,
as
well
as
his
heal.
Remember
that
the
base
healing
component
is
a
flat
amount
modified
by
additional
ability

so
even
if
the

not

you

still
be

It

wise
to
use
to
chase
down
an
enemy

Using

keep

you
can
use

or
when
he
has
a
high
amount
of

as
it
is
almost
always
a
sign
he
is
trying

restore

Early

Vladimir
lacks
any
hard
crowd
control
to
interrupt
channeled
abilities,
but
watch
out
as
his
allows
him
to
avoid
abilites
that
have
effects

or
he
can

(like
)
Vladimir
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
champions
at
late
game,
as
he
becomes
virtually
unkillable,
with
overwhelming
damage
and
can
wreck
past
an
AP
mage's
normal
counters,
fighters
,
if
he
is
able
to
reach
this
point
defeating
him
proves
extremely
difficult.
Focusing
Vladimir
in
a
teamfight
is
not
a
very
good
idea
-
he
is
very
tanky
due
to
his
passive,
he
can
restore
his
health
quickly
and
lose
all
focus
with
.
Trying
to
kill
him
takes
a
long
time
if
he
is
properly
positioned
and
can
distract
your
team
from
other
key
enemy
targets
such
as
the
ADC
and
assassins.
If
you
fail
to
kill
Vladimir
late
game
and
he
escapes
he
will
be
able
to
fully
restore
his
health
with
minions
and
jungle
monsters
without
going
to
back
to
base.
Do
not
underestimate
late
game,
especially
if
fully
stacked.
Average
late
game
Vladimir
can
dish
out
from
450
-
540
damage,
pre
mitigation,
from
to
all
surrounding
enemies.
With
some
cool
down
reduction,
he
can
spam
this
spell
continously
and
easily
wreak
havoc
if
left
unchecked.
Try
to
Vladimir
into
using
his
early
in
a
fight
so
he
takes
more
damage
from
it
and
cannot
use
it
to
escape
focus
fire.
Vladimir
will
use
20%
of
his
current
health
whenever
he
uses
,
so
if
you
force
him
to
use
it,
you've
effectively
won
the
trade.
Even
if
Vladimir
uses
he
still
takes
damage
from
DoT
spells
such
as
,
,
,
and
.
Remember
that
doesn't
heal
until
the
particle
returns
to
him,
and
because
the
animation
is
two-staged
(impalement,
then
return),
most
single-target
projectiles
like
,
,
and
will
generally
hit
him
before
he's
healed.
This
is
useful
to
remember
should
you
be
uncertain
about
last-hitting
him.
You
can
use
to
remove
(which
is
usually
paired
with
)
if
he
uses
it
on
you.
So
buying
it
against
Vladimir
is
a
good
and
rather
cheap
counter.
Due
to
his
passive,
he
gains
health
as
his
spells
grow
more
powerful,
however
this
leaves
him
vulnerable
to
health

damage
items
and
abilities
