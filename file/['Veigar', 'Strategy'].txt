short

time
as
possible,
choosing
smart

make
it
easier
to

all
spells
at
once,
especially
when
using
additional

of
the

it's

to

2

players.
You
can
use
impact
animation
to
cordon
off
your
foes;
place
the
spell
near
the
champion
but
angled
towards
the
direction
in
which
he
is
most
likely
to
retreat.
Placing
a
at
the
enemy

camp
means
you
can
use

to
clear
it
whenever
it
spawns

easy
gold

the

is
denied.
Care
should
be
taken
as
to
missing
opponents
and
the
location
of
the
jungler
when
attempting
this,
however.
Using
your
against
enemy
champions
with
high
ability
power
can
have
devastating
effects,
due
to
its
scaling
off
your

as
yours.

When
shoving

so
you
can
recall

consider
using

Due
to
and
being
targeted
spells,
they
should
always
be
used
after
casting
since
they
are
sure
to
always
hit.
An
advanced
tactic
is
to
use
before
landing

While
it
is
difficult
to
master,
if
you
have
aimed
both
spells
correctly
the
enemy

be
able
to
escape
before

Another
advanced
tactic,
you
can
sometimes
use
to
bait
an
enemy

then
