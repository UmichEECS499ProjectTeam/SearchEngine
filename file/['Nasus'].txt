Nasus
the
Curator
of
the
Sands
or
Release
date
Nasus
drains
his
foe's
spiritual
energy,
giving
him
a
natural
/
/
%
life
steal.
Nasus'
next
attack
within
the
next
10
seconds
will
deal
bonus
physical
damage.
If
the
attack
kills
its
target,
Nasus
gains
3
stacks
of
Siphoning
Strike.
The
number
of
stacks
gained
is
doubled
for
killing
champions,
large
minions
and
large
monsters.
Siphoning
Strike's
bonus
damage
is
increased
by
an
amount
equal
to
his
current
stacks.
Additional
Information:
Nasus
ages
his
target,
slowing
their
movement
speed
by
35%
for
5
seconds.
The
slow
increases
over
the
duration.
The
target's
attack
speed
is
also
slowed
by
half
the
amount,
initially
slowed
by
17.
%
and
increasing
over
the
duration.
If
the
duration
of
Wither
is
reduced
by
crowd
control
reduction,
the
increasing
slow
is
applied
faster
so
that
it
reaches
the
same
max
amount
at
the
end.
Nasus
unleashes
a
spirit
flame
at
a
target
400-radius
area,
dealing
magic
damage
to
enemies
caught
within.
The
spirit
flame
burns
for
5
seconds
afterwards,
dealing
magic
damage
each
second
and
reducing
the
armor
of
enemies
within
the
area.
Additional
Information:
Nasus
summons
a
sandstorm
to
empower
himself
for
15
seconds,
enlarging
his
size,
gaining
bonus
health
and
increasing
his
attack
range
by
50.
While
the
storm
rages,
enemies
within
175
range
take
magic
damage
equal
to
a
percentage
of
their
maximum
health
(max
of
240
magic
damage
per
second
per
enemy).
Nasus
converts
6.
%
of
the
damage
done
by
the
sandstorm
into
bonus
attack
damage
for
himself.
The
maximum
bonus
attack
damage
that
can
be
gained
is
300.
