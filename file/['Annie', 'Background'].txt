Years
after
the
exodus,
Gregori
and
Amoline
had
a
child:
Annie.
Early
on,
Annie's
parents
knew
there
was
something
special
about
their
daughter.
At
the
age
of
two,
Annie
miraculously
ensorcelled
a
shadow
bear
-
a
ferocious
denizen
of
the
petrified
forests
outside
the
colony
-
turning
it
into
her
pet.
To
this
day
she
keeps
her
bear
by
her
side,
often
keeping
him
spellbound
as
a
stuffed
doll
to
be
carried
like
a
child's
toy.
The
combination
of
Annie's
lineage
and
the
dark
magic
of
her
birthplace
have
given
this
little
girl
tremendous
arcane
power.
It
is
this
same
girl
who
now
finds
herself
as
one
of
the
most
sought-after
champions
within
-
even
by
the
city-state
who
would
have
exiled
her
parents
had
they
not
fled
beforehand.

Announcement
made
by
:
Tibbers
the
League
of
Legends
In
the
time
shortly
before
,
there
were
those
within
the
sinister
city-state
of
who
did
not
agree
with
the
evils
perpetrated
by
the
High
Command.
The
High
Command
had
just
put
down
a
coup
attempt
from
the
self-proclaimed
Crown
Prince
Raschallion,
and
a
crack
down
on
any
form
of
dissent
against
the
new
government
was
underway.
These
political
and
social
outcasts,
known
as
the
Grey
Order,
sought
to
leave
their
neighbors
in
peace
as
they
pursued
dark
arcane
knowledge.
The
leaders
of
this
outcast
society
were
a
married
couple:
Gregori
Hastur,
the
Grey
Warlock,
and
his
wife
Amoline,
the
Shadow
Witch.
Together
they
led
an
exodus
of
magicians
and
other
intelligentsia
from
Noxus,
resettling
their
followers
beyond
the
Great
Barrier
to
the
northern
reaches
of
the
unforgiving
.
Though
survival
was
a
challenge
at
times,
the
Grey
Order's
colony
managed
to
thrive
in
a
land
where
so
many
others
would
have
failed.

"Annie
may
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
champions
ever
to
have
fought
in
a
Field
of
Justice.
I
shudder
to
think
of
her
capabilities
when
she
becomes
an
adult."

little
girl...
Hah!"
"You

to
Tibbers'
tea
party!
Bleh!"

fire!"
"Get

Tibbers!"
"Bear
hug!"
"Tibbers!"
"Yay,
Tibbers!"
"Found

"Uh...
*cough*
