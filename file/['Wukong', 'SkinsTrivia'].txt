The
name
"Wukong"
means
"awakening
to
emptiness"
or
"perceiving
air"
(悟空)
in
Chinese.
Wukong
is
voiced
by
.
Wukong's
character
concept
is
inspired
by
and
directly
based
off
of
,
the
protagonist
of
the
Chinese
novel
.
Wukong
is
also
one
of
the
few
champions
to
be
based
on
a
public
domain
character
of
mythology
in
general.
(Sun
Wukong
is
also
romanized
as
"Son
Gokuu"
in
Japanese.)
Wukong
is
the
first
champion
to
have
an
animated
.
The
internal
name,
the
name
that
is
used
by
the
game
developers
themselves,
for
Wukong's
ultimate
is
"MonkeyKingSpinToWin",
a
reference
to
the
popular
community
description
for
.
Coincidentally,
much
of
kit
is
a
possible
basis
for
,
mainly
due
to
both
characters
having:
Wukong's
now
holds
the
record
for
the
highest
AD
Ratio
in
the
game,
achieving
a
4.8
AD
Ratio
under
a
full
duration
of
the
spell.
During
the
animation
of
Wukong's
joke,
he
elongates
his
staff
very
much.
This
is
how
the
staff,
known
as
the
Ruyi
Jingu
Bang/Nyoi
Kinko
Bou
(如意金箍棒,
lit.
Compliant
Gold-Rimmed
Staff)
actually
functions
in
the
original
novel
for
reaching
or
attacking
his
target
afar,
as
well
as
also
changing
in
nearly
all
forms
of
general
size.
Wukong
himself
even
gloats
that
he
can
attack
the
enemy
base
from
such
a
position
(though
due
to
obvious
gameplay
reasons,
this
actual
feat
cannot
be
done
in
such
a
way).
Said
staff
was
known
for
weighing
13,500
jin,
which
was
around
8,100
kg
or
17,800
lbs.
It
was
also
made
of
"crow
iron",
a
rare
form
of
black
iron.
,
along
with
and
are
three
of
the
current
MOBA's
to
feature
a
character
based
off
of
Sun
Wukong.
All
three
of
them
(including
pre-worked
Sun
Wukong)
have
very
similar
abilities
and
playstyles
(mainly
being
damaging
tanks
with
assassin
potential,
and
having
very
unique
tricks
with
their
abilities).
Classic
Wukong's
Chinese
splash
art's
water
dragon
(also
in
the
Jade
Dragon
arts)
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Dragon
who
swallowed
's
mount
in
the
,
causing
Wukong
to
fight
against
it.
Volcanic
Wukong
may
be
a
reference
to
aforementioned
prequel
story
when
Sun
Wukong
was
locked
in
a
cauldron
by
the
Taoist
Lao
Tzu
(on
behalf
of
the
Jade
Emperor
to
assist
in
executing
him
as
no
options
were
left)
to
be
distilled
by
severe,
sacred
fires
for
40-50
days
straight
and
turned
into
an
elixir.
But
when
Lao
Tzu
opened
the
lid,
Wukong
was
alive
and
stronger
than
ever
with
the
ability
the
(金睛火眼,

Gold
Gazing
Fire
Eyes)
which
enabled
him
to
see
evil
(but
gave
him
a
weakness
to
smoke).
Jade
Dragon
Wukong
wears
,
which
is
commonly
carved
in
the
form
of
a
dragon.
General
Wukong
also
plays
nod
to
some
traditional
armor
Sun
Wukong
wears
during
the
aforementioned
prequel
tale,
due
to
being
more
"war"
oriented
throughout
most
of
the
story
with
him
against
the
heavens.
It
also
nods
to
the
more
famous
title
of
Wukong
as
well,
the
Qitian
Dasheng/Seiten
Taisei
(齊天大聖,

Sage).
