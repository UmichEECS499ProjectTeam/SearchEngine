fan
requests
for
a
female
tank.

Leona's
name
is
Latin
for
lioness.
Leon
means
Lion
in
French,
Greek,
Latin
and
Spanish
as
well.
Leona's
appearance
and
personality
are
heavily
inspired
by

wife;

face
was
drawn
with

a
reference.

final

the
main
difference
being
her
hair.
As
a
"Chosen
of
the
Sun",
and
with
sun-based
powers,
Leona
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Solar
Exalted
from
the
Tabletop
RPG
.
Leona's
dance
is
similar
to
the
Force-Shielder
Class
skill
called
"Shield
Break"
from
.

passive,
,

the
,
a
symbol

in
may
be
the
reason

theme

the
sun.

her
work
in
progress
poster,
her
shield
has
the
complete
Vergina
Sun
symbol

all
16
points,

mythology
who
wander
the
battle
fields
retrieving
slain
warriors
who
are
to
be
brought
to
Valhalla
after
a
glorious
death
in
battle.
This
is
fitting
as
a
skin
for
a
true
tank,

to
an
extent
decide
who
dies
in
battle
by
stunning
key
enemies
and
saving
allies.

Pool
Party
Leona

was
childhood
friends
with
.
Leona
and
are
adversaries,
with
Diana
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
Leona
being
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun".
A
post
by
IronStylus
in
the
thread
,
Diana
and
may
share
a
bond
between
one
another
as
more
then
the
"Chosen
of
the
Moon"
and
the
"Chosen
of
the
Sun".
This
can
only
be
implied
by
the
quote
"We
want
them
to
be
intertwined,
and
without
delving
too
far
into
assumptions
and
implications,
without
getting
too
detailed
about
their
past
relationship,
what
is
more
tragic
than
to
have
to
kill
someone
that
you
love?".
