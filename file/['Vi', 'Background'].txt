Vi
spits
on
the
ground
and
assumes
a
boxer's
fighting
stance.
Vi
takes
out
a
teacup
from
inside
her
gauntlet,
takes
a
sip,
then
throws
it
on
the
ground.
Vi
cups
one
of
her
hands
and
punches
it
with
her
other
fist.

first.
Ask

comes

on!
Resist

hit
it

I'll
beat

Gives

Makes

Stop

Ow,

Greetings
PBE
Summoners,
I
am
happy
to
announce
that
our
final
champion
of
the
year
is
now
(or
soon
will
be)
available
for
testing
on
the
PBE.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Vi,
the
Piltover
Enforcer.
Imagine
two
giant
hextech
gauntlets.
Now
imagine
a
total
badass
who
loves
using
those
gauntlets
to
hit
things.
Hard.
That's
Vi
in
a
nutshell.
Have
you
ever
wished
you
could
punch
an
enemy
with
such
an
impact
that
you
hit
the
enemies
behind
it?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
you
may
enjoy
playing
Vi.
Have
you
ever
had
the
desire
to
wind
up
a
punch
powerful
enough
to
carry
you
across
the
battlefield,
clocking
anyone
unlucky
enough
to
get
in
your
way?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
you
may
enjoy
playing
Vi.
Have
you
ever
wanted
to
indiscriminately
bowl
through
an
enemy
team,
wiping
the
smirk
off
that
AD
carry's
face
as
you
slam
it
into
the
ground?
If
your
answer
is
yes,
well,
you
get
the
idea.
Vi
is
all
about
powerful
punches.
She's
a
high
mobility
high
damage
bruiser
who
picks
a
target,
launches
herself
into
the
fray,
and
makes
that
target
deal
with
her.
So
what
are
you
waiting
for?
Go
try
her
out.
I'd
love
to
hear
your
feedback.
Best
of
luck
on
the
Fields
of
Justice!
There's
nothing
more
satisfying
than
the
sounds
of
your
enemies
succumbing
to
an
extreme
beat-down.
Not
to
Vi,
anyway,
the
newest
champion
to
join
the
League.
Punching,
excessive
force,
and
armor-busting
brutality
are
what
she’s
all
about.
At
home
in
top
lane
or
the
jungle,
Vi's
playstyle
revolves
around
pummeling
opponents
and
tearing
into
and
shattering
their
armor.
Vi's
signature
punch
is
Vault
Breaker.
When
you
first
activate
the
ability,
Vault
Breaker
begins
charging
a
powerful
punch.
Activating
Vault
Breaker
a
second
time
causes
you
to
dash
forward,
dealing
damage
to
units
and
knocking
back
enemy
champions.
Early
game,
Vi
excels
at
bullying
opponents
while
shoving
the
lane
with
Vault
Breaker
and
the
AoE
damage
from
Excessive
Force.
Skillful
use
of
Excessive
Force
allows
you
to
quickly
clear
your
lane
while
harassing
opponents
trying
to
get
in
close
to
last
hit
minions.
When
team
fights
erupt,
Vi's
ultimate
allows
you
to
charge
through
your
opponents'
front-line
and
crush
their
carries.
Assault
and
Battery
locks
on
to
an
enemy
champion.
You
then
chase
them
down,
uppercutting
them
into
the
air.
Enemies
unfortunate
enough
to
be
in
the
way
are
knocked
aside.
High
damage,
armor
debuffs,
and
knockbacks
make
you
a
disruptive
force.
Since
Vi's
attacks
and
activated
abilities
apply
stacks
of
Denting
Blows,
you
can
increase
your
damage
significantly
against
armored
opponents
by
just
doing
what
you
do
best:
punching.
To
top
it
all
off,
Vi's
Blast
Shield
helps
her
survive
not
only
big
damage
bursts,
but
also
prolonged
team
fights.
Are
you
ready
to
slip
on
your
gauntlets
and
show
off
your
pummeling
prowess?
Once
your
opponents
get
a
glimpse
of
your
heavy
weaponry,
it's
punch
or
be
punched.
