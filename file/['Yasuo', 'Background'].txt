Yasuo
is
a
man
of
resolve,
an
agile
swordsman
who
wields
the
wind
itself
to
cut
down
his
foes.
But
this
once
proud
warrior
has
been
disgraced
by
a
false
accusation
and
forced
into
a
desperate
fight
for
survival.
With
the
world
turned
against
him,
he
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
bring
the
guilty
to
justice
and
restore
his
honor.
Once
a
brilliant
pupil
at
a
renowned
sword
school,
Yasuo
was
the
only
student
in
a
generation
to
master
the
legendary
wind
technique.
Many
believed
he
was
destined
to
become
a
great
hero.
However,
his
fate
was
changed
forever
when
invaded.
Yasuo
was
charged
with
guarding
an
Ionian
Elder,
but,
foolishly
believing
his
blade
alone
could
make
the
difference,
left
his
post
to
join
the
fray.
By
the
time
he
returned,
the
Elder
had
been
slain.
Disgraced,
Yasuo
willingly
turned
himself
in,
prepared
to
pay
for
his
failure
with
his
life.
He
was
shocked,
however,
to
find
himself
accused
not
just
of
dereliction,
but
of
the
murder
itself.
Though
confused
and
racked
with
guilt,
he
knew
the
assassin
would
go
unpunished
if
he
did
not
act.
Yasuo
raised
his
sword
against
the
school
and
fought
his
way
free,
knowing
his
treason
would
turn
all
of
Ionia
against
him.
Now
truly
alone
for
the
first
time
in
his
life,
he
set
out
to
find
the
Elder's
real
killer.
Yasuo
spent
the
next
several
years
wandering
the
land,
seeking
any
clue
that
might
lead
him
to
the
murderer.
All
the
while,
he
was
relentlessly
hunted
by
his
former
allies,
continually
forced
to
fight
or
die.
His
mission
drove
him
ever
forward,
until
he
was
tracked
down
by
the
one
foe
he
dreaded
most
–
his
own
brother,
Yone.
Bound
by
a
common
code
of
honor,
the
two
warriors
bowed
and
drew
their
swords.
Silently
they
circled
one
another
under
the
moonlight.
When
they
finally
charged
forward,
Yone
was
no
match
for
Yasuo;
with
a
single
flash
of
steel
he
cut
his
brother
down.
Yasuo
dropped
his
weapon
and
rushed
to
Yone's
side.
Overcome
with
emotion,
he
demanded
to
know
how
his
own
kin
could
think
him
guilty.
Yone
spoke:
“The
Elder
was
killed
by
a
wind
technique.
Who
else
could
it
be?”
Understanding
swept
over
Yasuo
as
he
suddenly
realized
why
he
had
been
accused.
He
professed
his
innocence
once
more
and
begged
his
brother's
forgiveness.
Tears
streamed
down
Yasuo's
face
as
his
brother
passed
in
his
arms.
Yasuo
tosses
his
flask
into
the
air
and
catches
it
on
his
sword.
Delve
into
Yasuo's
past
and
uncover
how
he
became
known
as
the
Unforgiven.
Ionian
Noxus
Yasuo
buried
Yone
under
the
rising
sun,
but
could
take
no
time
to
mourn.
Others
would
be
after
him
before
long.
His
brother's
revelation
had
given
Yasuo
newfound
purpose;
he
now
had
the
clue
that
would
lead
to
the
true
killer.
Swearing
an
oath,
he
gathered
his
belongings
and,
with
one
last
look
at
Yone's
grave,
set
out
with
the
wind
at
his
back.

What
is
a
sword
without
the
man
behind
it?
Teaching
a
swordsman
to
kill
is
simple.
The
true
challenge
lies
in
teaching
him
not
to
kill.
Today,
Yasuo
committed
an
act
of
treason
by
murdering
the
very
person
he
was
sworn
to
protect.
He
has
betrayed
his
nation,
his
friends,
and
himself.
Were
it
not
for
my
actions,
I
wonder
if
he
would
have
been
swept
down
this
dark
path.
But
my
task
is
not
to
question;
I
must
bear
the
burden
of
my
duty.
At
first
light
tomorrow,
I
set
out
to
capture
a
sword
without
a
sheath:
my
brother
Yasuo.
―
Yone
When
I
was
a
child,
my
brother
asked
me:
does
the
wind
flee,
or
does
it
follow?
But
until
then,
I
will
not
flee.
I
will
follow
the
truth.
Let
the
wind
guide
my
blade
and
lead
me
to
the
true
murderer
–
the
one
responsible
for
the
blood
on
my
hands.
―
Yasuo,
the
Unforgiven
The
story
of
a
sword
is
inked
in
blood.
"A
lot
of
people
want
me
dead
-
they
call
it
justice.
I'm
the
only
one
who
knows
the
truth.
All
I
have
left
is
the
wind
by
my
side.
"Death
is
like
the
wind;
always
by
my
side."
"A
sword's
poor
company
for
a
long
road."
"My
honor
left
a
long
time
ago."
"No-one
is
promised
tomorrow."
"Follow
the
wind,
but
watch
your
back."
"This
blade
never
gets
any
lighter."
"Virtue
is
no
more
than
a
luxury."
"The
road
to
ruin
is
shorter
than
you
think."
"Sleep
is
for
the
guiltless."
"Justice.
That's
a
pretty
word."
"Hmph.
One
step
ahead
of
the
past."
"A
wanderer
isn't
always
lost."
"Just
looking
for
a
road
home."
"Never
could
stay
in
one
place."
"I
will
follow
this
path
until
the
end."
"Honor
is
in
the
heart,
not
the
name."
"I
will
not
forget
who
I
am."
"This
story
is
not
yet
finished."
"Is
a
leaf's
only
purpose
to
fall?"
"Hmph...
dying's
the
easy
part."
"People
keep
running
into
my
blade."
"I'll
give
you
the
easy
way
out."
"No
cure
for
fools."
"Kill
me?
You
can
try."
"It's
just
death.
Nothing
serious."
"Make
it
quick."
"Don't
start
what
I'll
finish."
"At
peace
with
yourself?
You
will
be."
"Some
things
never
dull."
"Some
mistakes
you
can't
make
twice."
"I
will
not
die
dishonored."
"No
more
running."
"I
alone
decide
my
fate."
"One
blade,
one
purpose."
"It
is
not
yet
time
to
die."
"The
blade
above
all
things...
except
a
good
drink."
"Who
says
I
can't
handle
my
drink?"
"There
are
three
certainties
in
life:
honor,
death,
and
hangovers."
"There
is
only
death...
mine,
or
yours!"
"If
you've
come
to
kill
me...
I
hope
you
brought
friends."
"Killing
people
is
a
bad
habit...
but
I
can't
seem
to
quit."
"Wuju?
Hmph.
Never
heard
of
it."
"Wuju?
No,
I
wouldn't."
"Nice...
sword...
boots?"
"Scurry
back
to
your
shadows,
ninja."
"Ninjas...
I
hate
those
guys."
"Cute
mask.
Your,
uh,
mom
sew
that?"
"Which
weighs
more,
Riven?
Your
blade,
or
your
past?"
"Everyone
faces
a
reckoning,
Riven."
"You
can't
run
from
yourself,
Riven...
I've
tried."
"Broken
sword.
Broken
spirit."
Yasuo
laughs.
Yasuo
laughs.
Yasuo
laughs.
