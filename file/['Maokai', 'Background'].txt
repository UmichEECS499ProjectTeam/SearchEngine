Maokai

a
sapling
on
his
foot,
throws
it
in
the
air
and
eats
it.
The
sapling
the
comes
out
of
his
arm
and
returns
to
his
hand.
Maokai
throws

it.
Maokai's

silences
them.

Sometimes,
when
you
look
at
the
League
of
Legends
champion
lineup,
it’s
easy
to
feel
like
you’ve
seen
it
all.
You’ve
seen
light
mages,
thorn
mages,
mad
scientists,
illusionists,
ninjas,
and
warriors
with
gigantic
swords.
But
there’s
something
that
this
next
champion
has
that
none
of
them
do:
roots.
That’s
right,
while
you
may
have
been
engaged
in
epic,
pitched
battles
with
trolls,
gargoyles,
ogres,
scarecrows,
minotaurs,
mummies,
and
mutant
armadillos,
I
bet
you’ve
never
had
to
fight
a
tree
before!
Introducing
Maokai,
the
Twisted
Treant;
a
groundbreaking
new
champion
in
the
League
of
Legends
whose
bark
may
or
may
not
be
worse
than
his
bite.
You
decide.
“To
defy
the
natural
order
has
consequences.”
―
“I
will
use
this
power
until
I
am
free
of
it.”
―
"I
do
your
bidding...
for
now.."
"Begone
vile
magics!"
"I
will
punish
their
imprudence."
"Reckless
mages."
"I
will
end
this
misuse
of
magic."
"They
will
know
my
remorse."
"Do
you
want
to
see
twisted?"
"This
power...
I
cannot
control!"
"Torment
me
no
longer!"
"To
rest...
if
only
I
could."
"This
life
was
not
meant
to
be."
"You
should
not
defy
nature!"
"There
is
no
escape."
"I
once
had
peace."
"Return
me
to
the
forest..."
"I
would
end
this
burden,
but
it
always
returns."
"Nature
is
the
truest
form
of
balance.
Eat
and
avoid
being
eaten."
"Animals
are
lazy.
We
plants
produce
our
own
food."
"Is
this
what
they
call
getting
stumped?
Hahaha!"
"Nature
can
be
a
real
mother.
Hahaha!"
