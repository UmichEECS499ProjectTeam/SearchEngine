The
Ionians
fought
admirably,
but
soon
Ionian
blood
stained
the
land
beneath
the
prints
of
foreign
boots.
At
the
Great
Stand
of
the
Placidium,
Ionians
prepared
for
surrender,
but
were
inspired
to
maintain
their
resistance
when
the
young
Irelia
hoisted
her
father’s
enormous
blade
and
pledged
to
hold
until
her
brother
returned.
In
the
chaos
of
the
ensuing
fight,
Irelia
was
cursed
with
dark
Noxian
necromancy.
As
her
life
ebbed,
,
made
a
final
attempt
to
anchor
Irelia’s
fading
soul.
Unwilling
to
relinquish
her
home,
Irelia
rose
at
the
brink
of
death,
and
her
father’s
sword
lifted
in
the
air
alongside
her.
Irelia
rushed
back
to
the
fore,
unfazed
by
the
blade's
sudden
animation.
The
weapon
danced
around
her
effortlessly,
cutting
down
Noxians
as
they
gaped
in
horror.
The
decimated
invaders
were
forced
to
retreat
from
the
Placidium.
Irelia
was
appointed
Ionia's
Captain
of
the
Guard,
and
when
the
defense
of
her
homeland
moved
to
,
so
did
she.
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peek
by
:
the
Fields
of
Justice
The
have
developed
some
of
the
most
breathtaking
and
deadly
martial
arts
on
all
of
–
just
one
manifestation
of
their
pursuit
of
enlightenment.
The
most
remarkable
blade
style
to
emerge,
however,
was
the
unusual
byproduct
of
foreign
intervention.
Master
Lito
was
a
swordsman
whose
teachings
were
sought
by
ruling
classes
from
nearly
every
city-state.
His
art
was
a
highly-guarded
secret,
but
it
was
said
that
swords
would
breathe
in
his
grasp.
He
withered
unexpectedly
from
a
mysterious
disease
which
baffled
the
brightest
of
Runeterran
physicians.
When
he
died,
he
left
behind
Zelos
and
Irelia,
his
son
and
daughter,
and
a
truly
unique
weapon.
Zelos
became
a
Sergeant
in
the
Ionian
military
and
left
to
seek
assistance
from
immediately
prior
to
'
invasion
of
Ionia.
Irelia,
charged
with
the
protection
of
their
home
until
Zelos
returned,
was
alone
when
Noxian
forces
struck.
The
champion
was
officially
revealed
first
in
the
November
issue
of
:
Ionians
Runeterra
Demacia
Noxus
The
sword
flourishes,
as
though
painting
with
blood.
―Taken
from
a
"My
blade
is
at
your
service!"
"There's
no
turning
back."
"Cut
them
down."
"It
ends
here."
"This
battle
will
be
won."
"They
will
not
prevail."
"This
way."
"Justice
guides
us."
"I
will
not
falter."
"With
precision."
"Forge
onward."
"Ionia
shall
not
fall."
"I
stand
resolute."
"Stay
sharp."
"True
will
cannot
be
defeated."
"You
rely
on
your
weapons
too
much;
try
letting
go!"
"Balance
in
all
things."
"My
blade
is
not
only
precise,
but
totally
gnarly."
Irelia
laughs.
Irelia
laughs.
Irelia
laughs.
Irelia
laughs.
Air
is
the
same
as
water,
you
simply
must
heed
the
ripples.
What
did
he
always
say
after-
Irelia
was
designed
by
PC
Gamer
Designed
to
be
a
burst
melee
DPS
character
that
thrives
whens
she's
outnumbered,
Irelia's
biggest
weakness
is
stuns
and
other
crowd
control.
Her
abilities
-
a
dash
whose
cooldown
is
refreshed
when
you
successfully
kill
a
target
with
it,
a
passive
boost
to
her
attack
speed
when
surrounded
by
opponents
and
an
ultimate
ability
that
summons
one
or
more
floating
blades
to
fight
alongside
her.
If
you
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
November
issue
of
PC
Gamer,
then
you've
already
had
your
first
look
at
the
League's
latest
champion.
If
you
missed
that
issue,
then
it’s
my
great
honor
to
officially
introduce
Irelia,
the
Will
of
the
Blades.
In
addition
to
being
the
latest
in
our
long
line
of
pretty
ladies
to
join
the
League
of
Legends,
Irelia
serves
as
the
captain
of
the
Ionian
Guard
--
which
only
goes
to
show
that
there's
no
glass
ceiling
when
you
have
a
telekinetic
command
over
swords.
So
watch
yourself!
Irelia
brings
new
meaning
to
the
old
proverb:
"Walk
softly,
but
carry
a
big
sword."
Hey,
wait...
did
I
get
that
right?
