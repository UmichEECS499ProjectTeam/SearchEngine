There
once
was
a
man
named
Corin
Reveck
who
had
a
daughter
named
Orianna,
whom
he
loved
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world.
Though
Orianna
had
incredible
talent
for
dancing,
she
was
deeply
fascinated
by
the
of
.
This
fascination
compelled
her
to
begin
training
to
become
such
a
champion.
It
is
unfortunate
that
her
sheltered,
wide-eyed
naivete
led
her
to
take
unnecessary
and
dangerous
chances
which
ultimately
led
to
her
tragic
demise.
Orianna's
death
shattered
Corin,
driving
him
into
deep
depression
and
an
obsession
with
techmaturgy.
He
could
not
stand
the
void
his
daughter's
death
left
in
his
life,
so
he
decided
to
build
a
replacement
–
one
that
would
complete
Orianna's
dream
of
joining
the
League.
What
was
created
is
the
clockwork
killing
machine
that
Corin
named
after
his
daughter.
Knowing
that
she
was
destined
to
be
a
champion
and
seeing
the
way
the
times
were
changing,
he
created
The
Ball
as
her
pet
and
protector.
This
nearly
symbiotic
creation
uses
a
different
type
of
techmaturgy,
relying
more
heavily
on
electricity
than
clockwork.
Orianna
and
The
Ball
now
fight
as
Champions
in
the
League
of
Legends,
using
her
sometimes
misguided
morality
as
a
compass.
She
tries
in
earnest
to
fit
in
with
those
around
her.
However,
no
matter
how
hard
she
tries,
Orianna
can
never
be
human
and
there
is
always
something
unnerving
and
alien
about
her.
Though
she
attempts
social
interaction
with
other
champions
in
the
League
of
Legends,
there
are
few
who
can
get
past
her
exotic
nature.
To
many,
it's
as
if
there's
nothing
inside,
that
Orianna
is
just
a
soulless
clockwork
shell
–
a
dangerous
and
deadly
one
at
that.
However,
all
along
she
remains
the
perfect
daughter
in
her
father's
eyes.
Orianna
does
a
pirouette
and
leans
back.
If
she
has
the
ball,
it
will
catch
her.
If
she
does
not
have
the
ball
she
falls
to
the
ground.

There
are
many
champions
in
League
of
Legends
who
teach
us
that
--
no
matter
who
you
are
--
it’s
extremely
important
to
make
sure
that
you
have
the
right
tools
of
the
trade.
Take
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl,
for
instance.
Anywhere
she
goes,
you’ll
see
her
mysterious,
spherical
pet
following
her
about.
The
befuddlement
over
Orianna’s
mechanical
pet
started
when
we
found
this
schematic
while
rummaging
through
a
few
art
department
sketches.
After
every
member
of
the
Art
Team
failed
to
identify
it,
we
began
to
deliberate
about
what
its
mysterious
origins
might
be.
While
waiting
for
the
results
of
our
highly
scientific
in-house
carbon
dating
tests,
the
greatest
historians
at
Riot
games
have
been
busily
speculating
about
its
possible
origins.
Theories
range
from
diagrams
of
a
lost
Viking
rune
stone,
to
blueprints
from
a
first
edition
Jules
Verne
novel,
to
a
discarded
schematic
from
Leonardo
Da
Vinci’s
notebook.
But
then,
where
would
the
Vikings
get
the
technology
for
a
clockwork
contraption?
What
use
is
a
mechanized
sphere
when
you’re
20,000
leagues
under
the
sea?
What
would
Da
Vinci
want
with
schematics
for
a
mechanical
ball?
After
debunking
all
these
theories,
only
one
thing
became
clear:
Orianna’s
contraption
was
no
ordinary
ball.
If
working
on
League
of
Legends
for
this
long
has
taught
us
anything,
it’s
that
when
it
comes
to
building
a
champion,
it
pays
to
have
an
eye
for
quality.
Well,
whether
you’re
a
hextech
enthusiast
or
you’re
just
in
the
market
for
a
new
watch,
if
you’ve
got
any
appreciation
for
fine
craftsmanship
you
should
have
a
look
at
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl
and
her
pet
ball.
That’s
right,
we
said
pet
ball!
And
while
it
might
be
strange
to
see
a
metal
lady
walking
around
everywhere
with
a
mechanical
sphere,
we’re
willing
to
wager
that
once
you
see
what
she
can
do
with
it
you’ll
be
in
the
market
for
a
pet
ball
yourself.
Just
don’t
tell
your
friends
you’re
headed
down
to
the
jeweler’s
for
a
new
pet.
They
might
look
at
you
funny.
Summoners!
We’d
love
to
give
you
a
sneak-peak
at
some
of
Orianna,
the
Clockwork
Girl’s
gameplay
features.
We’re
blazing
new
mechanical
trails
with
this
champion,
and
we
want
to
share
the
excitement
with
you.
Orianna’s
key
gameplay
hook
is
commanding
her
primary
weapon
–
an
animated
hextech
ball
that
she
uses
as
a
focus
for
her
abilities.
This
ball
acts
as
a
focal
point
for
all
of
her
skills,
allowing
her
to
dynamically
control
space.
By
moving
The
Ball
(as
she
named
it)
and
then
activating
skills,
you
can
use
it
to
deal
magical
damage,
attach
it
to
allies
(then
use
them
as
the
focal
point
for
your
skills),
shield
friends,
or
even
move
enemies
out
of
position.
Knowing
how
and
when
to
use
Orianna’s
abilities
-
combined
with
strategic
setup
-
can
deny
entire
areas
of
a
combat
zone
or
support
a
key
ally
and
act
as
a
force
multiplier.
To
add
risk
to
the
kit,
her
passive
encourages
her
shorter-range
auto-attacks
to
maximize
her
damage
output.
This
means
you
can
play
safer
and
use
the
long
range
of
Orianna’s
ball,
but
to
lesser
effect
than
if
you
combine
it
with
auto-attacks.
We
made
this
decision
in
order
to
create
an
interesting
dichotomy
of
risk/reward
that
will
allow
expert
Orianna
players
to
stand
out.
We
want
to
push
the
boundaries
in
our
champion
creation
and
your
impressions
and
feedback
can
help
shape
this.
Let
us
know
what
you
think!
