The

Karma
was
designed
by
Summoners!
If
you're
a
fan
of
Ionian
champions,
or
just
a
fan
of
fans
in
general,
you're
really
going
to
take
to
this
next
champion.
It
is
my
pleasure
to
introduce,
Karma,
the
Enlightened
One,
to
the
League
of
Legends.
Along
with
a
pair
of
particularly
deadly
looking
fans,
Karma
brings
an
elegant
look
and
a
particularly
level
headed
disposition
to
the
League
of
Legends.
Keep
an
open
mind.
After
all…
we
can
all
use
a
little
enlightenment.
Looks
like
our
cover's
been
blown…
Yep,
this
is
new
Karma.
Yep,
this
is
a
big
change.
We
believe
Karma
needed
a
reimagining,
and
we
are
going
to
talk
to
you
about
we
feel
that's
the
case.
But
before
we
dig
into
it,
there's
something
you
should
probably
know
first
–
:
This
is
important,
because
we
know
there
are
lots
of
fans
(heh)
of
Karma's
existing
look,
and
we
don't
want
to
take
that
for
granted.
We
actually
have
been
working
on
a
dev
diary
that
talks
about
our
thought
process
behind
Karma's
relaunch,
but
since
the
cat's
out
of
the
bag...we'll
share
the
story
and
art
sections
of
the
dev
diary
right
here,
right
now.
We'll
release
the
full
dev
diary,
including
details
on
her
new
kit,
when
she's
ready
for
PBE
(which
is
pretty
soon).
Without
further
ado,
here's
her
new
splash:
Grumpy
Monkey
will
talk
a
little
about
her
new
visual
design,
and
then
Runaan
will
give
you
some
insight
into
Karma's
reimagined
backstory.
Karma's
original
look
had
a
few
shortcomings
that
we'd
like
to
address
for
her
relaunch.
For
starters,
her
aesthetic
was
hard
to
read
and
didn't
really
convey
much
about
her
character.
Her
fans,
dress
and
posture
didn't
reflect
her
playstyle
or
storyline.
There
was
a
lot
we
could
change
about
Karma
to
bring
a
more
cohesive
vision
to
the
character.
First,
we
made
sure
that
Karma's
new
look
showed
off
her
status
as
a
paragon
of
Ionia
while
appearing
unique
on
the
battlefield.
Her
floating
fans
weren't
cutting
it
as
magical
conduits,
so
we
replaced
them
with
a
powerful
manifestation
of
her
Ionian
will.
Now,
Karma
carries
the
draconic
symbol
of
Ionia
with
her
at
all
times.
We
also
decked
her
out
in
Ionian
garb
to
emphasize
her
allegiance.
We
also
crafted
a
new
set
of
animations
that
emphasized
her
status
as
a
champion
of
Ionia
rather
than
a
matronly
diplomat.
This
new
approach
to
Karma
transforms
her
into
a
badass
conduit
of
inner
strength
that
brings
Ionia's
strength
to
every
battlefield.
In
the
past,
we've
created
engaging
characters
that
epitomize
the
ideals
of
their
homeland.
Garen
as
the
Might
of
Demacia
or
Darius
as
the
Hand
of
Noxus
are
good
examples.
With
Karma,
we
wanted
to
capture
Ionia,
a
place
of
wisdom
and
great
spiritual
power.
We
also
wanted
to
hold
onto
much
of
Karma's
characterization.
She's
a
strong
leader
and
a
mystic
who
stands
apart
from
other
champions.
The
connection
between
Karma's
motif
and
playstyle
was
never
as
clear
as
it
could
have
been.
She
didn't
have
a
distinct
theme
that
tied
everything
together
and
brought
out
the
badass
spiritual
leader
she
is
in
her
lore.
Ionia
is
a
land
that
has
suffered
greatly.
The
ongoing
struggle
has
taken
its
toll
on
Karma's
calm,
composed
demeanor.
We
wanted
to
evolve
Karma's
personality
to
suit
her
place
in
a
nation
filled
with
internal
strife
and
awakened
ferocity.
Karma
can
now
manifest
her
inner
spirit
and
willpower
as
powerful
magical
energy.
With
her
inner
flame
she
can
inspire
and
protect
her
allies,
damage
foes
and
manipulate
the
spiritual
bonds
between
those
around
her.
We've
also
taken
her
Ionian
ties
a
step
further:
her
magic
springs
from
the
crest
of
twin
dragons
in
her
mantle,
literally
and
figuratively
transforming
her
into
a
symbol
of
her
homeland.
The
changes
we've
made
have
given
new
life
to
Karma's
title,
"The
Enlightened
One."
In
the
past,
her
title
conveyed
her
serenity
and
calm.
Now,
it
represents
the
enlightened
path
she's
found
for
Ionia:
a
new
path,
merging
the
spiritual
traditions
of
Ionia
with
the
nation's
newfound
strength.
Finally,
we've
given
Karma
new
VO
that
conveys
her
internal
struggle
and
intensity.
Karma's
attempting
to
unite
a
wounded
and
divided
nation,
which
is
no
easy
task!
We
want
you
to
believe
she's
got
the
inner
strength—and
inner
flame—that
it
takes
to
persevere.
Karma's
now
the
powerful
Ionian
leader
she
was
always
meant
to
be.
Through
her
determination
and
indomitable
spirit,
she's
set
to
rebuild
Ionia
and
inspire
her
people
to
greatness.
Karma's
kit
was
in
a
weird
place,
but
her
ultimate
was
especially
problematic.
Her
base
abilities
didn't
feel
impactful
and
only
felt
effective
when
supercharged
by
Mantra.
On
top
of
that,
when
Karma
had
two
charges
of
Mantra,
we
had
to
make
both
of
them
weaker
to
compensate
for
players
double
casting
empowered
spells.
The
changes
we
made
to
Karma's
kit
focused
on
making
each
decision
fun
and
meaningful
while
giving
her
abilities
the
focus
they
needed
to
perform
her
intended
role.
We
kept
the
"empowering"-type
gameplay
of
Mantra,
but
instead
of
waiting
around
for
it
to
recharge,
Karma's
basic
attacks
and
abilities
now
lower
Mantra's
cooldown.
This
rewards
aggressive
play
so
you
can
"buyback"
her
ultimate.
Also,
we
gave
Mantra
a
single
charge
to
pump
extra
power
into
each
cast.
We
also
made
sure
Mantra
empowers
Karma's
abilities
in
drastically
different
ways,
leading
to
more
impactful
decision-making
and
a
better
feeling
of
accomplishment
when
you
pull
off
the
right
move
at
the
right
time.
Karma
had
the
offensive
tools
to
support
her
team
in
small
skirmishes
but
not
the
powerful
defensive
abilities
she
needed
to
protect
a
team.
Also,
her
all-purpose
abilities
are
so
broad
they
never
felt
like
the
right
choice
in
any
situation.
All
in
all,
Karma
lacked
direction.
The
effectiveness
of
Karma's
abilities
relied
too
heavily
on
your
teammates
knowing
all
their
nuances.
No
matter
how
hard
you
were
carrying
with
Karma,
your
teammates
had
to
be
just
as
good
with
her
for
you
to
be
super
effective.
When
an
ally's
confused
about
whether
or
not
he
should
run
from
or
pass
through
your
Spirit
Bond,
we
probably
made
a
mistake.
Despite
all
the
Mantra
hate
we've
got
going
on,
we
actually
think
the
concept
is
pretty
kickass.
It's
unique
and
character-defining
to
old
Karma,
and
augmenting
her
abilities
with
an
immense
surge
of
Ionian
will
is
visually
and
thematically
fun.
We
also
liked
how
Karma
could
turn
the
tables
on
her
opponents
with
abilities
that
provided
defensive
bonuses
and
had
hidden
offensive
power.
Finally,
Spirit
Bond's
"clothesline"
gameplay
is
really
cool,
but
it'd
work
better
on
a
tank
champion
that
has
an
easier
time
jumping
into
the
fray.
Originally
envisioned
as
a
support,
Karma's
fringe
successes
actually
came
from
players
using
her
in
the
top
or
mid
lanes
as
an
AP
burst
mage
with
support
abilities,
much
like
or
.
We
like
this
direction
and
want
to
encourage
you
to
boost
both
her
offensive
and
support
abilities
by
building
AP.
We
also
want
to
make
sure
she
can
hold
her
own
as
a
solo
or
with
a
lane
partner.
Finally,
we've
updated
her
skills
so
allies
are
reliant
on
Karma,
but
Karma's
not
reliant
on
them.
She's
got
enough
power
at
her
fingertips
to
feel
strong
as
a
mage
or
as
a
support
without
teammates
having
to
work
in
perfect
concert
for
you
to
be
effective.

We've
talked
a
lot
about
giving
Karma
a
complete
overhaul,
and
we're
ready
to
discuss
her
changes.
Karma's
relaunch
is
the
real
deal,
covering
her
art,
abilities
and
lore
for
a
total
renovation.
We
know
she's
been
the
source
of
a
lot
of
contention
since
her
launch,
but
we
also
know
that
she's
got
a
cult
following
of
Karma
diehards.
Here's
an
overview
of
why
we
think
she
needs
a
rework.
Karma's
aesthetics
are
confusing.
While
she
looks
cool,
it's
difficult
to
read
her
role
at
face
value.
Grumpy
Monkey
has
provided
more
info
for
you
on
Karma's
look.
We've
also
seen
players
eschew
her
support
role
for
bursty
mage
gameplay,
so
we
seized
this
opportunity
to
give
Karma
more
options
in
lane.
Scarizard
has
talked
more
on
Karma's
evolving
mechanics.
We
also
think
that
Karma
needs
a
new
story
that
suits
her
updated
abilities
and
aesthetics.
RiotRunaan
has
taken
you
through
Karma's
transformation
into
an
unstoppable
Ionian
leader.
For
Karma
diehards,
we
have
a
special
treat
–
we'll
be
giving
those
of
you
who've
unlocked
Karma
a
skin
based
on
her
traditional
look.
Karma's
getting
an
extended
PBE
stay
so
we
can
thoroughly
test
her
new
gameplay
and
incorporate
your
feedback.
These
abilities
were
part
of
Karma's
original
kit,
in
use
from
her
release
in
until
her
rework
in
.
