Some

Keep
in
mind
that

more

than

and
that

do
not

if

Think
twice
before

enemy

such
as

them
to

This
is
not
an
issue
with
due
to
this

having
only
600
range,
while
Evelynn's
stealth
range
is
700.
Always
look
out
for
in
your
lane.
Because
of
her
stealth,
she
can
easily
sneak
behind
unsuspecting
players
who
are
overextended.
Be
aware
that
her
movement
speed
boost
can
make
her
very
surprising.
You
can
protect
your
lane
by
purchasing
s
and
placing
them
in
the
river.
Be
careful
if
using
s
as
if
she
comes
into
your
brush
already
stealthed,
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
her
until
she
unstealths,
and
that
may
be
too
late.
Evelynn
can
be
built
with
either
,
or
even
a
mix
of
both.
Pay
attention
to
the
way
she
builds
to
better
decide
what
defensive
items
you
should
buy.
However,
she
still
deals
a
lot
of
magic
damage
even
with
an
build,
so
Magic
Resistance
is
rarely
a
bad
option
against
her.
If
Evelynn
is
building
AD,
she
has
a
very
weak
early
and
mediocre
mid,
but
trades
for
extremely
high
damage
late
game.
If
you
are
a
squishy
champ,
stay
behind
tanks
and
try
to
focus
her
down.
Evelynn's
stealth
is
lost
when
she
takes
damage.
Harassing
her
greatly
reduces
her
sneaking
ability.
If
you
think
Evelynn
is
near,
use
skill
or
AoE
spells
(Like
a
or
)
in
her
direction.
If
they
hit
it
will
disable
her
passive
and
reveal
her.
