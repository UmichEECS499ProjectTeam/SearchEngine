Leona’s
parents
were
traditional
Rakkor,
both
bred
for
the
heat
of
battle.
To
them,
Leona
was
a
problem
child.
She
was
capable
of
fighting
as
fiercely
as
any
other
–
including
her
childhood
friend,
–
but
she
did
not
share
their
zeal
for
killing.
She
believed
that
the
true
worth
of
a
soldier
lay
in
her
ability
to
defend
and
protect.
When
it
came
time
for
her
Rite
of
Kor,
a
ceremony
in
which
two
Rakkor
teens
battle
to
the
death
for
the
right
to
bear
a
relic-weapon,
Leona
refused
to
fight.
For
this,
the
Rakkor
leaders
ordered
her
execution,
but
when
they
tried
to
strike
the
fatal
blow,
sunlight
burst
forth,
bathing
Mount
Targon
in
light.
As
it
faded,
Leona
stood
unharmed
and
her
executioners
lay
unconscious
around
her.
The
Solari
immediately
claimed
Leona,
demanding
that
her
sentence
be
repealed.
She
donned
the
golden
armor
of
the
Solari
and
they
bestowed
upon
her
the
sword
and
shield
passed
down
from
the
ancient
sun-warrior
of
legend.
The
Solari
helped
Leona
focus
her
abilities,
and
when
she
was
ready
she
left
to
join
.
Leona
plants
her
sword
and
shield
beside
her
and
massages
her
hands.

On
the
upper
slopes
of
,
the
warriors
of
Rakkor
live
and
breathe
only
for
war.
However,
Targon's
peak
is
reserved
for
a
special
group
of
Rakkor
who
answer
to
a
"higher"
calling.
Members
of
this
group,
called
the
Solari,
retire
their
mantles
of
war,
choosing
instead
to
devote
their
lives
to
reverence
of
the
sun.
According
to
legend,
the
Solari
were
formed
by
a
warrior
who
could
call
the
raw
might
of
the
sun
down
upon
his
enemies
in
combat.
He
claimed
Mount
Targon's
summit,
the
point
on
closest
to
the
sun,
for
his
solar
devotion,
a
tradition
which
generations
of
Solari
have
preserved
to
this
day.
Though
they
maintain
their
reverence,
no
other
warrior
possessed
the
gifts
of
the
founder
–
until
Leona.

Since
we
launched
League
of
Legends,
there’s
been
quite
a
bit
of
clamor
about
equal
rights
amongst
tanks.
Well,
at
Riot
Games,
we
like
to
think
of
ourselves
as
a
progressive
company,
and
today
we’re
here
to
show
our
commitment
to
equal
opportunity
tanking.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Leona,
the
Radiant
Dawn.
In
addition
to
being
a
defender
of
all
that
is
good
and
light,
Leona
is
a
strong,
independent
woman
ready
to
throw
down
and
tank
with
the
best
of
them.
Greetings
Summoners!
We
wanted
to
give
you
a
glimmer
of
insight
into
the
mechanics
of
our
newest
champion,
Leona,
the
Radiant
Dawn.
Leona
is
a
bit
special
because
she’s
our
answer
to
a
pretty
popular
fan
request;
a
female
tank!
I
think
a
good
place
to
start
is
to
answer
“what
exactly
does
‘tank’
mean
to
us
at
Riot?”
Starts
and
initiates
teamfights
(usually
via
CC).
Soaks
up
damage.
May
peel
dangerous
attackers
off
other
vulnerable
team
mates.
Presents
itself
as
an
attractive
target
by
causing
long-term
“threat”
as
the
fight
continues.
Leona
does
this
by
providing
a
low-cooldown,
low-duration,
single-target
stun
with
a
skillshot
gap-closer
to
start.
After
she
closes
the
gap
to
the
enemy,
she’ll
be
performing
regular
single-target
stuns
that
really
disrupt
the
fight
or
peel
off
a
target
from
an
ally
once
a
fight
has
begun.
Additionally,
she
has
a
defensive
stance
that
allows
her
to
soak
up
punishment
pretty
effectively
and
also
discharges
a
wave
of
sunlight
outward
that
causes
significant
damage.
This
mechanic
acts
as
a
sort
of
“soft
taunt”
that
causes
her
to
have
some
threat
when
she’s
about
to
unleash
a
big
chunk
of
damage,
and
makes
her
an
attractive
target.
Finally,
her
passive,
Sunlight,
causes
all
of
Leona’s
spells
to
debuff
the
target,
causing
the
next
attack
from
an
ally
to
do
additional
damage.
This
really
encourages
Leona
to
mark
high-priority
targets
and
let
her
set
up
opportunities
for
her
teammates.
Her
power
increases
with
the
length
of
the
fight,
a
common
tank
trait
(like
or
,
for
example).
We’re
excited
to
be
able
to
deliver
something
we’re
really
proud
of
to
meet
our
players’
requests
and
expectations.
Keep
letting
us
know
what
you
want
–
we
do
take
your
feedback
seriously.
Summoners!

the
Locket
