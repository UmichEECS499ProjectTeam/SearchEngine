Thresh
was
designed
by
.
To
"thresh"
means
to
separate
grain
from
wheat,
usually
with
a
sickle,
or
by
a
revolving
mechanism.
Thresh's
weapon
is
very
similar
to
a
sickle,
and
his
victims
and
their
souls
could
be
seen
as
the
wheat
and
grain.
The
way
Thresh
swings
his
chain
could
allude
to
the
way
grain
is
separated
from
wheat
using
a
revolving
mechanism.
Thresh
is
the
first
to
be
released
in
2013.
Thresh
is
possibly
inspired
by
the
,
particularly
the
rider
symbolizing
Death.
(The
other
horsemen
theme
champions
to
have
been
released
so
far
are
and
.)
Thresh
was
the
first
champion
to
be
released
with
the
new
champion
price
structure,
costing
7800
for
the
first
week.
When
Thresh
dies
his
own
soul
is
harvested
by
his
lantern.
You
can
faintly
hear
his
fearful
laments
as
his
soul
is
removed.
Thresh's
story
is
similar
to
that
of
the
main
antagonist,
a
mad
doctor,
from
the
movie
.
Both
loved
torturing
their
prisoners/patients
until
the
victims'
riot
which
resulted
in
their
revenge
against
the
warden/doctor,
but
both
returned
to
continue
their
murderous
and
sadistic
acts.
Thresh
tricked
wife,
Senna,
and
trapped
her
soul
in
his
lantern,
for
which
he
seeks
revenge.
The
weapon
that
Thresh
uses
is
similar
to
the
-
a
weapon
that
consists
of
a
sickle
attached
to
a
metal
chain
with
a
heavy
weight
at
the
end.
The
weapon
was
traditionally
used
by
ninjas
in
.
Thresh
and
were
previously
the
only
ranged
champions
classified
as
tanks.
However,
as
of
the
Summer
2013
role-rework,
Thresh
is
now
classified
as
a
Support/Fighter.
Thresh
is
the
second
ranged
champion
to
not
use
projectiles
for
ranged
basic
attacks,
the
first
being
.
When
reaching
a
certain
amount
of
movement
speed,
Thresh's
movement
animation
shows
him
gliding
instead
of
running.
When
Thresh
dances,
he
swings
his
scythe
and
his
lantern
like
a
pair
poi
(or
kiwido
or
bolas),
a
side
by
side
comparison
can
be
seen
.
The
tricks
Thresh
does
is
a
basic
forward
weave,
a
stationary
forward
windmill
and
an
alternating
behind-the-back
butterfly.
With
all
his
hooks,
chains,
many
of
the
elements
in
his
background,
and
the
ability

"Keeper
of
Lost
Souls"
(former),
"Flay",
and
"The
Box"
it
is
possible
that
Thresh's
motif
is
a
reference
to
franchise.
Thresh's
ability
has
a
unique
quirk;
unlike
most
spells
with
a
windup
casting
time,
Thresh
does
not
face
the
specific
direction
he
is
casting
the
ability
until
he
actually
sends
out
the
hook.
deliberately
designed
the
ability
to
fit
in
with
Thresh's
theme
of
causing
terror
in
his
enemies.
Thresh
is
the
first
champion
with
an
ability
that
can
affect
an
allied
champions
position,
namely
.
Thresh
currently
has
the
strongest
slowing
effect
in
the
game,
with
slowing
by
99%.
Thresh's

is
a
reference
to
the
nursery
rhyme(s)
"Rain

and/or
"Ring

Although

Thresh's

Thresh
is
the
first
champion
to

classic
skin.
Thresh

The
skin
has
many
references
to
the
number
three,
likely
due
to
being
released
as
a
promotional
skin
for
the
Season
Three
World
Championship.
Examples
of
this
are
Thresh's
robe
splitting
into
three
tails,
the
top
of
his
lantern
being
split
into
three
parts
and
the
presence
of
a
crest
with
three
lines
on
his
back
resembling
the
Roman
numeral
for
three.
The
skin
may
be
a
reference
to
from
the
franchise,
and
in
turn
a
reference
to
the
legend
of

The
skin
shows
some
resemblance
to
the
design
of
the
character
Davy
Jones
and
his
crew,
with
a
similar
dark
aquatic
motif.
To
'send
someone
to
Davy
Jones'
Locker'
is
a
euphemism
for
sending
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
effectively
damning
them;
Deep
Terror
Thresh
may
be
a
twist
on
the
legend
of
Davy
Jones,
with
his
lantern
being
the
literal
'locker'.
