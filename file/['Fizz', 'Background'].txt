Centuries
ago,
an
ancient
water-dwelling
race
built
a
hidden
city
beneath
a
mountain
in
the
sea.
Though
these
creatures
had
their
enemies,
the
city
was
an
impenetrable
fortress,
and,
in
the
safety
it
provided,
they
grew
complacent.
Fizz,
however,
harbored
a
curious
spirit
that
could
not
be
satisfied
living
so
cushioned
a
life.
Unable
to
resist
the
allure
of
danger,
Fizz
had
a
habit
of
sneaking
out
of
the
city
to
look
for
trouble.
In
his
many
adventures
he
grew
to
be
a
powerful
fighter
with
a
sharp
cleverness
that
let
him
skirt
danger
with
ease.
One
day
Fizz
returned
to
find
the
city
abandoned:
his
people
had
vanished,
leaving
Fizz
without
a
clue
to
explain
their
disappearance.
With
nothing
left
in
the
city
to
keep
him,
Fizz
salvaged
an
enchanted
seastone
trident
from
the
ruins
and
set
out
alone.
Fizz
wandered
the
ocean
in
search
of
his
people
for
years,
using
the
skills
he'd
learned
during
his
adventures
as
a
young
boy
to
survive.
Finally,
Fizz
discovered
the
port
of
.
He
was
fascinated
with
the
existence
of
life
above
the
water
and
could
not
resist
exploring
the
island.
In
his
endless
curiosity,
Fizz
inadvertently
meddled
in
the
affairs
of
the
humans
who
lived
there,
and
his
presence
did
not
go
unnoticed.
His
mischief
angered
many
residents
who
eventually
sought
to
capture
or
kill
him.
Fizz
found
himself
cornered,
and
he
prepared
to
return
to
the
sea
despite
the
fondness
he'd
come
to
hold
for
Bilgewater.
As
he
stood
at
the
docks,
a
massive
dragon-shark
attacked
the
port.
Fizz
defeated
the
beast,
using
his
resourcefulness
and
knowledge
of
the
creature's
weaknesses
to
his
advantage.
Having
earned
the
gratitude
and
respect
of
the
humans,
Fizz
decided
to
stay
in
Bilgewater.
To
further
serve
his
new
home,
he
joined
.
Fizz
falls
asleep.
Fizz
throws
a
fish
into
the
air
and
eats
it.
