Throughout
,
the
resolve
of
military
is
alternately
celebrated
or
despised,
but
always
respected.
Their
"zero
tolerance"
moral
code
is
strictly
upheld
by
civilians
and
soldiers
alike.
In
combat,
this
means
troops
may
not
make
excuses,
flee,
or
surrender
by
example.
Garen,
the
valiant
warrior
who
bears
the
title
"the
Might
of
Demacia",
is
the
paradigm
to
which
these
leaders
are
compared.
Thousands
of
great
heroes
have
risen
and
fallen
on
the
bloody
battlefields
between
and
its
preeminent
rival,
.
It
was
beneath
their
mighty
banners
of
war
that
Garen
first
met
steel
with
.
The
infantrymen
who
beheld
this
event
(and
survived)
commented
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
two
were
locked
in
a
mortal
waltz
set
against
a
symphony
of
clashing
blades.
Garen,
the
pride
of
the
Demacian
military
and
the
leader
of
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
returned
from
this
battle
breathless
for
the
first
time
in
his
career,
though
some
speculate
this
was
due
to
reasons
other
than
exhaustion.
The
plausibility
of
these
rumors
was
bolstered
when,
in
every
instance
thereafter,
Garen
seized
the
opportunity
to
encounter
the
Sinister
Blade
again.
A
paragon
of
Demacian
ethic,
Garen
never
entertained
such
allegations,
for
he
knew
others
couldn't
understand.
Even
simply
the
pursuit
of
a
worthy
opponent
on
the
battlefield
is,
to
a
true
warrior,
the
reason
to
rise
each
morning.
The
promise
of
one,
particularly
one
so
beautifully
and
diametrically
opposed,
is
the
validation
of
his
existence.

So,
lately,
I've
