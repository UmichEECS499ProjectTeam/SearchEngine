The
work
of
gravediggers
is
essential
amongst
the
living,
but
invaluable
in
the
.
There
are
many
shades
of
death
there,
and
each
is
embraced
rather
than
feared
or
reviled.
One
can
only
ascend
from
one
state
to
the
next
with
the
magical
aid
of
a
skilled
professional.
At
the
end
of
the
first
Rune
War,
Yorick
Mori
made
his
living
as
a
gravedigger.
His
family
owned
and
maintained
the
Final
Rest
Memorial,
one
of
the
oldest
cemeteries
in
.
The
shovel
he
employed
for
his
work
had
been
passed
down
for
generations.
Each
gravedigger
taught
his
son
that
this
shovel
was
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
every
forefather,
and
that
those
spirits
would
protect
him
during
the
long
lonely
nights
amongst
the
tombstones.
To
his
eternal
regret,
Yorick
died
without
an
heir,
bringing
the
proud
Mori
line
to
a
close.
His
body
was
interred
with
his
shovel
in
the
family
mausoleum,
and
the
Final
Rest
Memorial
soon
fell
to
ruin.
Death,
however,
was
not
the
end
Yorick
had
expected.
Yorick
emerged
on
the
haunted
shores
of
the
Shadow
Isles
–
not
quite
dead,
definitely
not
alive
–
still
clutching
his
beloved
shovel.
He
soon
learned
that
with
it
he
could
act
as
a
ferryman
for
the
Isles'
undead
denizens,
helping
them
climb
death's
many-tiered
ladder.
This
proved
a
curse,
as
a
gravedigger
must
"bury
his
quota"
before
he
too
can
ascend,
or
so
the
legend
goes.
No
one
knows
what
"his
quota"
is.
Yorick
dug
tirelessly,
waiting
in
vain
for
the
day
when
he
would
be
freed
of
his
burden.
As
decades
turned
to
centuries,
the
shame
of
his
failures
came
to
a
head.
He
returned
to
Valoran
to
find
his
corpse,
convinced
that
salvation
might
be
buried
with
it.
When
he
arrived,
no
trace
remained
of
either
the
mausoleum
or
the
memorial.
Hope
nearly
lost,
he
discovered
the
,
and
there
saw
an
opportunity
to
immortalize
the
family
name
he
allowed
to
be
forgotten
ages
ago.

"Death

"Answers

"There

"Death

"You

"Life

"Embrace

"Who

"The

"Everything

"Fill

"Another

"Join

"Live

are
so...
fragile."
"They
will
make
splendid
corpses."
"Do
you
hear
the
ghouls?"
"I
will
bury
you
alive!"
"I
think
I
might
know
a
relative
of
yours.
No
hair...
sagging
flesh...
always
going
on
about
brains.
Ring
any
bells?"
Yorick
laughs.
Yorick
laughs.
Yorick
laughs.
Yorick
laughs.
"Wither."
"Rot."
"Torment!"
"Devour!"
"Feast!"
"Haunt!"
"Alas,
poor
Yorick."
"Are
you
lonely,
Yorick?"
"As
you
wish,
Gravedigger"
"Get
to
your
task,
gravedigger!
Make
our
numbers
endless!"
"Bring
out
your
dead!
Bring
out
your
dead!!"
"Slay
them
Gravedigger!
Make
them
serve
us!"

The
true
sign
of
a
master
is
when
you’re
able
to
impress
everyone
with
your
execution
of
a
skill
that
might
otherwise
be
considered
mundane.
So
it’s
probably
quite
safe
to
say
that
in
order
to
dazzle
anyone
with
your
skillful
shoveling,
you’re
going
to
have
to
be
rather
good
at
it.
With
this
in
mind,
allow
me
to
introduce
Yorick,
the
Gravedigger.
In
addition
to
being
more
adept
in
the
art
of
entombment
than
any
who
have
come
before
him,
he
makes
a
point
of
keeping
good
company…
or
at
least
ravenous
undead
company.
One
of
those
two.
Greeting
Summoners!
We
wanted
to
give
a
sneak-peak
into
Yorick’s
gameplay
in
a
quick
mini-update.
Yorick
is
our
first
champion
that
utilizes
the
creation
and
use
of
summoned
minions.
All
of
Yorick’s
spells
have
varying
immediate
effects,
but
each
leaves
behind
a
different
minion
of
the
appropriate
type.
For
example,
Omen
of
Pestilence
creates
an
AOE
explosion
at
the
target
location
that
does
damage
and
slows,
and
leaves
behind
a
Decaying
Ghoul.
This
ghoul
will
then
slow
targets
adjacent
to
it
during
its
lifespan.
All
Ghouls
have
a
constantly
draining
life
bar
that
limits
their
lifespan
to
a
short
duration,
and
enemies
attacking
them
will
shorten
it
even
more.
Yorick
isn’t
some
frail,
weak
Necromancer
that
just
commands
minions
though
–
he’s
a
burly
fighter
who
can
dish
out
punishment
on
his
own.
This
was
done
primarily
to
make
his
play
more
consistent
(as
frail
summoners
typically
have
really
binary
PvP
gameplay
on
if
their
minions
are
up
or
not).
Yorick
can
get
into
a
fight
and
go
toe-to-toe
with
enemies
while
commanding
an
ever-changing
army
of
undead
Ghouls.
Omen
of
Death
is
his
trademark
ultimate
that
brings
players
back
from
the
dead
to
exact
Vengeance.
Yorick
can
use
this
Omen
on
an
ally,
which
creates
a
revenant
of
that
champion.
If
that
champion
is
killed
while
the
revenant
exists,
then
the
target
gains
temporary
undeath,
coming
back
from
the
dead
at
full
life
which
drains
on
its
own
rapidly.
After
the
risen
ally
runs
out
of
health
again,
they
collapse
once
more.
We
really
hope
you
enjoy
our
new
master
of
undeath
in
the
upcoming
patch!
