There
exists
an
ancient
order
originating
in
the
Isles
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
balance.
Order,
chaos,
light,
darkness
--
all
things
must
exist
in
perfect
harmony
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
universe.
This
order
is
known
as
the
and
it
employs
a
triumvirate
of
shadow
warriors
to
uphold
its
causes
in
the
world.
Kennen
is
one
of
these
shadow
warriors,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Coursing
the
Sun
-
tirelessly
conveying
the
justice
of
the
Kinkou.
Kennen
was
born
in
and
it
is
said
that
in
his
first
living
moments
he
bolted
first
from
the
womb
and
second
from
the
midwife
who
delivered
him.
His
parents
had
thought
that
he
would
outgrow
his
boundless
energy,
but
as
he
matured,
his
energy
found
no
limits
and
was
matched
only
by
his
unnerving
speed.
Despite
his
astonishing
gifts,
he
remained
unnoticed
(or
at
least
uncaught,
as
he
was
quite
the
prankster)
until,
on
a
dare,
he
ran
straight
up
the
great
outer
wall
of
the
Placidium.
When
word
of
this
feat
reached
Kinkou
ears,
Kennen
was
quickly
and
quietly
brought
for
an
audience.
He
found
that
the
role
of
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest
suited
him,
frenetically
delivering
both
the
word
and
the
punishments
of
the
Kinkou
across
the
realm.
He
now
works
with
his
fellows
and
to
enforce
the
balance
of
.
This
hallowed
pursuit
has
unsurprisingly
led
the
triumvirate
to
the
.

"The

remember

"The

never
lie."
"Haaayaaa!"
"A
silent
death!"
"Time
to
strike!"
"Their
final
moments
approach."
"For
Ionia."
"From
the
shadows!"
"Ready."'
"Let's
do
it!"
"Yes
yes
yes!"
"I
am
the
wind!"
"Balance
in
all
things."
"Steady..."
"Big
targets
are
the
best!
There's
more
to
aim
at!"
"Yes,
they
make
shurikens
this
small!"
Kennen
laughs.

While
we've
all
seen
what
Shen
can
do
out
there
on
the
battlefield,
it
bears
mentioning
that
Ninjas
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes.
Allow
me
to
introduce
you
all
to
Kennen,
the
Heart
of
the
Tempest.
Unlike
Shen,
Kennen
originally
hails
from
Bandle
City,
home
of
the
yordles,
and
this
fleet-footed,
pint-sized
ninja
terror
is
every
bit
as
lethal
as
his
compatriot.
Let
it
never
be
said
that
the
Kinkou
Order
is
closed
minded
with
regard
to
their
choice
of
students!
But
whatâ€™s
the
flip
side
to
having
two
equally
lethal
ninja
champions?
Well,
it's
a
well
known
fact
that
ninjas
work
alone!
That's
right,
ninjas
have
a
tendency
to
step
on
each
other's
toes,
yordle
or
otherwise.
So
while
you
might
be
tempted
to
deploy
as
many
flippin'
ninjas
as
you
can
get
your
hands
on,
use
caution!
