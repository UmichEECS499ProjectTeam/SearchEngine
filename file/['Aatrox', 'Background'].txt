The
earliest
tale
of
Aatrox
is
as
old
as
recorded
history.
It
tells
of
a
war
between
two
great
factions
remembered
only
as
the
Protectorate
and
the
Magelords.
Over
time,
the
Magelords
won
a
series
of
crushing
victories,
leaving
them
on
the
brink
of
obliterating
their
sworn
enemy
forever.
On
the
day
of
their
final
confrontation,
the
Protectorate
army
found
themselves
outnumbered,
exhausted,
and
poorly
equipped.
They
braced
for
inevitable
defeat.
Just
when
all
hope
seemed
lost,
Aatrox
appeared
among
the
ranks
of
the
Protectorate.
With
but
a
few
words,
he
urged
the
soldiers
to
fight
to
the
last
before
throwing
himself
into
battle.
His
presence
inspired
the
desperate
warriors.
At
first,
they
could
only
watch
in
awe
as
this
unknown
hero
cleaved
through
their
enemies,
his
body
and
blade
moving
in
unison
as
if
one
being.
Soon,
the
warriors
found
themselves
imbued
with
a
potent
thirst
for
battle.
They
followed
Aatrox
into
the
fray,
each
fighting
with
the
furious
strength
of
ten
until
they
had
won
a
most
unlikely
victory.
Aatrox
vanished
after
that
battle,
but
the
Protectorate
army's
newfound
fury
did
not.
Their
surprising
triumph
led
to
many
more
until
they
were
able
to
finally
return
home
victorious.
Their
countrymen
hailed
them
as
heroes,
but
though
they
had
saved
their
entire
civilization
from
destruction,
darkness
lingered
in
the
mind
of
each
warrior.
Something
within
them
had
changed.
Over
time,
their
memories
of
battle
faded,
only
to
be
replaced
with
a
grim
revelation:
their
acts
of
heroism
were,
in
fact,
brutal
atrocities
committed
by
their
own
hands.
Aatrox
is
a
legendary
warrior,
one
of
only
five
that
remain
of
an
ancient
race
known
as
the
Darkin.
He
wields
his
massive
blade
with
grace
and
poise,
slicing
through
legions
in
a
style
that
is
hypnotic
to
behold.
With
each
foe
felled,
Aatrox's
seemingly
living
blade
drinks
in
their
blood,
empowering
him
and
fueling
his
brutal,
elegant
campaign
of
slaughter.
Tales
like
these
appear
among
the
myths
of
many
cultures.
If
they
are
all
to
be
believed,
Aatrox's
presence
has
changed
the
course
of
some
of
the
most
important
wars
in
history.
Though
these
stories
remember
him
as
a
savior
in
dark
times,
Aatrox's
true
legacy
may
be
a
world
filled
with
conflict
and
strife.
"Some
fight
for
honor,
some
fight
for
glory.
It
matters
only
that
you
fight."

battle
will

of
all."

am

"Let
fear
become
fury!"
"I

lurks
in
the
hearts
of
men."
"Hesitation
is
death."
"Nobody
understands
me!
They
called
my
work
a
hack
job."
"This
is
no
mere
massacre;
this
is
my
masterwork!"
"Fight
and
be
remembered
as
a
hero,
or
die
and
be
remembered
as
a
coward."
"Fight
as
a
hero,
or
die
as
a
coward."
"Fight
and
be
remembered,
or
die
and
be
forgotten."
"Die
with
fear
in
your
heart,
or
win
with
blood
on
your
hands."
"Even
those
who
have
nothing
can
give
their
lives."
Aatrox
laughs.
Aatrox
laughs.
"Witness
truth!"
"Behold!"
"Tryndamere,
my
greatest
creation."
"This
one's
rage
will
shape
the
world."
