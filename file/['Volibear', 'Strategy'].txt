due

it's
better
to
use

finish

Flinging

While

with
Volibear,
you

cancelling

this
may
be
more
significant
if

in

Volibear
excels
at
being
in
the
middle
of
a
teamfight
and
should
be
the
first
to
follow
an

Generally,
Volibear
should
take

When

lock

Be
careful
though,
as
the
enemy

may
take
this
as
an
initiation
and
launch
a
full
assault,
though
you
