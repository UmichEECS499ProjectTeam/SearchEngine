In
a
faraway
place
known
as
there
was
a
seafaring
marauder
called
Kegan
Rodhe.
As
was
his
people’s
way,
Kegan
sailed
far
and
wide
with
his
fellows,
stealing
treasures
from
those
unlucky
enough
to
catch
their
attention.
To
some,
he
was
a
monster;
to
others,
just
a
man.
One
night,
as
they
sailed
through
the
arctic
waters,
strange
lights
danced
over
the
frozen
wastes.
There
was
something
hypnotic
about
them;
it
was
something
that
drew
them
to
it
like
moths
to
a
flame.
Trekking
across
the
frozen
waste,
they
came
to
a
cave
covered
in
ancient
runes.
Though
the
meaning
of
the
runes
was
long
lost
to
them,
Kegan
led
the
way
inside.
Inside
a
perfect
cage
of
ice
floated
a
dancing
column
of
flame.
There
was
no
way
such
a
thing
should
be
burning,
especially
not
in
this
place.
However,
its
movement
was
as
hypnotic
as
a
siren's
song,
captivating
and
seductive.
While
the
others
stayed
back,
Kegan
could
not
help
but
approach
it
while
holding
out
his
hand...
That
is
the
last
thing
Kegan
Rodhe
remembers,
for
now
his
body
belongs
to
Brand.
It
is
a
creature
of
olden
times—perhaps
even
a
casualty
of
the
Rune
Wars.
It
is
known
in
ancient
texts
as
the
Burning
Vengeance.
It
is
a
creature
of
pure
fiery
hate
that
exists
for
no
other
reason
than
to
lay
waste
the
world
of
men
and
.
No
one
is
quite
sure
how
Brand
found
his
way
to
,
but
he
began
his
predations
at
once.
Overcome
by
forces,
he
was
given
a
choice:
fight
within
the
confines
of
or
die.
Naturally,
he
chose
to
use
his
destructive
powers
in
the
League,
for
now...
