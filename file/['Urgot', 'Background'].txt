There
are
warriors
who
become
great
for
their
strength,
cunning,
or
skill
with
arms.
Others
simply
refuse
to
die.
Urgot,
once
a
great
soldier
of
,
may
constitute
a
case
in
support
of
the
latter.
Prone
to
diving
headlong
into
enemy
battle
lines,
Urgot
sowed
chaos
throughout
the
enemy
ranks,
often
sustaining
grievous
injuries
in
the
process.
When
his
body
was
unable
to
weather
further
abuse,
the
crippled
Urgot
was
delegated
the
position
of
High
Executioner
of
Noxus.
By
this
time,
his
hands
had
been
ruined
and
he
could
barely
walk.
Scythe-like
grafts
affixed
to
his
maimed
limbs
served
to
carry
out
his
bloody
work.
Urgot
finally
met
his
end
at
what
should
have
been
his
finest
hour.
Because
of
his
military
background,
he
often
accompanied
detachments
into
foreign
territory
to
carry
out
judgment.
After
ambushing
an
enemy
force,
,
fell
into
the
clutches
of
Urgot's
division.
Too
far
from
Noxus
to
risk
transporting
their
prize
for
ransom,
Urgot
prepared
to
dispose
of
their
captive.
At
the
final
moment,
however,
the
Dauntless
Vanguard,
led
by
,
intervened,
and
Urgot
was
cut
in
two
by
the
zealous
warrior
as
he
scrambled
to
free
his
Prince.
In
recognition
of
his
service,
the
executioner's
remains
were
remanded
to
the
Bleak
Academy
for
reanimation.
A
lifetime
of
abuse,
however,
had
left
his
body
in
a
catastrophic
state;
proving
problematic
to
the
necromancers'
craft.
Professor
Stanwick
Pididly,
the
prevailing
scholar
of
,
offered
a
solution.
Within
Pididly's
laboratories,
a
nightmarish
new
body
was
forged
for
Urgot.
Now
as
much
machine
as
man,
Urgot
arrived
at
the
in
search
of
the
man
who
ended
his
life;
necromantic
energies
coursing
through
his
metal
veins.

Some
stories
bring
new
meaning
to
the
phrase:
"cautionary
tale,"
and
I'm
pretty
sure
that
this
one
qualifies.
Meet
Urgot,
the
Headman's
Pride.
As
you
might
be
able
to
tell,
this
bloke's
seen
a
few
scrapes
in
his
life
and,
by
this
point,
is
a
bit
the
worse
for
wear.
While
he
may
not
be
winning
any
beauty
contests,
you're
really
got
to
admit
it,
the
guy's
got
style.
Unless,
of
course,
you’re
an
arachnophobe.
Then
the
two
of
you
might
have
issues.
Be
on
the
lookout
for
Urgot

Justice
