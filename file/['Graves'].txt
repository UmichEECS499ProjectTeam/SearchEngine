Graves
the
Outlaw
or
Release
date
Graves
gains
/
/
bonus
armor
and
magic
resistance
every
second
he
remains
in
combat.
This
bonus
stacks
up
to
10
times.
Graves
is
considered
in
combat
if
he
has
dealt
or
received
damage
in
the
last
3
seconds.
Additional
Information:
Graves
fires
three
bullets
in
a
cone,
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
in
their
path.
Enemies
at
close
range
can
be
hit
by
multiple
projectiles,
but
each
bullet
beyond
the
first
will
deal
only
35%
damage.
Graves
fires
a
smoke
canister
at
the
target
area,
dealing
magic
damage
upon
landing
and
creating
a
cloud
of
smoke
250
wide
for
4
seconds.
Enemies
inside
the
smoke
cloud
will
be
slowed
and
will
have
their
vision
reduced
to
675
range;
everything
else
will
look
like
it
is
in
the
Fog
of
War.
Additional
Information:
Graves
dashes
forward,
gaining
an
attack
speed
boost
for
4
seconds.
Using
autoattacks
on
enemy
units,

not
structures,
lowers
the
cooldown
of
Quickdraw
by
1
second
each
autoattack.
Graves
fires
an
explosive
shell
in
a
straight
line,
dealing
heavy
physical
damage
to
the
first
champion

hits
(also

After
hitting
a

the
end
of
its
range,
the
shell
explodes
dealing
physical
damage
in
a
cone
behind
the
target.
