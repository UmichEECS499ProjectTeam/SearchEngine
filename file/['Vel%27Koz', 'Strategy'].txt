Vel'Koz's
high
base
damage,
CC,
and
additional
passive
true
damage
makes
CDR
one
of
the
most
valuable
stats.
Vel'Koz
AP
ratios
are
somewhat
low,
making
AP
less
useful
than
on
other
mages,
but
still
desirable.
Vel'Koz's
high
base
damage
gives
him
good
mileage
out
of
Magic
Pen.
Since
many
of
his
abilities
have
some
form
of
CC
(heavy
slows,
knock-ups),
Liandry's
Torment
is
also
good
build
option.
Because
spamming
your
skills
is
required
to
activate
your
passive,
Vel'Koz
can
become
very
mana
hungry
early.
Buying
a
Chalice
of
Harmony
or
a
Catalyst
the
Protector
is
recommended.
Having
low
mobility
and
one
form
of
hard
CC,
Vel'Koz
is
vulnerable
to
assassins'
burst
damage.
Zhonya's
Hourglass's
active
is
very
helpful
in
letting
you
survive
a
burst.
Vel'Koz's
range
is
his
best
defense,
all
his
skills
are
skill
shots,
and
he
has
no
reliant
escape.
Thus,
high
mobility
champions
such
as
Fizz
or
Ezreal
can
counter
him.
His
true
damage
passive
makes
magic
resist
less
useful
for
countering
him.
It
may
be
better
to
purchase
movement
speed
enhancing
items
in
order
to
avoid
more
of
his
attacks,
and
health
to
reduce
the
percentage
of
health
that
his
true
damage
deals.
Lifeform
Disintegration
Ray
is
very
powerful,
but
he
turns
slowly.
It
can
be
best
avoided
by
walking
around
him.
Remember
that
the
closer
you
are
to
him,
the
easier
this
become.
Remember
that
Vel'Koz
can
keep
up
his
passive
stacks
with
his
auto
attacks.
When
you
have
two
stacks
make
sure
you
back
off
so
he
can't
update
the
stacks.
