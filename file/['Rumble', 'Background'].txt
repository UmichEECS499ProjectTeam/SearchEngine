Even
amongst
,
Rumble
was
always
the
runt
of
the
litter.
As
such,
he
was
used
to
being
bullied.
In
order
to
survive,
he
had
to
be
scrappier
and
more
resourceful
than
his
peers.
He
developed
a
quick
temper
and
a
reputation
for
getting
even,
no
matter
who
crossed
him.
This
made
him
something
of
a
loner,
but
he
didn't
mind.
He
liked
to
tinker,
preferring
the
company
of
gadgets,
and
he
could
usually
be
found
rummaging
through
the
junkyard.
He
showed
great
potential
as
a
mechanic.
His
teachers
recommended
him
for
enrollment
at
the
Yordle
Academy
of
Science
and
Progress
in
,
where
he
may
very
well
have
become
one
of
esteemed
protégés,
but
Rumble
refused
to
go.
He
believed
that
Heimerdinger
and
his
associates
were
"sellouts",
trading
superior
yordle
technology
to
humans
for
nothing
more
than
a
pat
on
the
head
while
yordles
remained
the
butt
of
their
jokes.
When
a
group
of
human
graduates
from
the
Yordle
Academy
sailed
to
to
visit
the
place
where
their
mentor
was
born
and
raised,
Rumble
couldn't
resist
the
temptation
to
see
them
face-to-face
(so
to
speak).
He
only
intended
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
humans,
but
four
hours
and
several
choice
words
later,
he
returned
home
bruised
and
bloodied
with
an
earful
about
how
he
was
an
embarrassment
to
"enlightened"
yordles
like
Heimerdinger.
The
next
morning
he
left
Bandle
City
without
a
word,
and
wasn't
seen
again
for
months.
When
he
returned,
he
was
at
the
helm
of
a
clanking,
mechanized
monstrosity.
He
marched
it
to
the
center
of
town
amidst
dumbfounded
onlookers
and
there
announced
that
he
would
join
to
show
the
world
what
yordle-tech
was
really
capable
of,
without
hiding
behind
a
foreign
banner.
As
Rumble
tries
to
speak,
Tristy
collapses
and
Rumble
kicks
it
and
hops
back
on.

Check,

and

Just
to
be
safe,
we'll
throw
in
one
mischievous
yordle
whose
mechanical
prowess
has
been
used
to
make
the
most
diabolical
machination
ever
to
hit
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Meet
Rumble,
the
Mechanized
Menace.
His
desire
to
see
you
burned,
speared,
crushed,
stomped,
blown
up,
or
otherwise
grievously
injured,
has
him
pushing
his
war
machine
way
beyond
what
would
be
considered
safe
operating
procedure,
even
if
he
might
blow
a
gasket.
But
don't
call
him
short.
That'll
really
grind
his
gears.
"Ugh,
it's
gonna
take
forever
to
scrape
your
face
off
my
suit!"
―
"Let's
get
in
the
fight!"
"Thought
you'd
never
ask."
"Ready
for
round
two."
"Baby,
don't
fail
me
now!"
"This
is
gonna
be
bumpy."
"Time
for
a
Bandle
City
beatdown."
"The
bigger
they
are,
the
harder
I
hit
'em."
"Now
we're
cookin'."
"Revved
up!"
"Who
wants
a
piece
of
this?"
"Hold
'er
steady."
"Alright...
I'm
going."
"Who
you
callin'
little?"
"You
don't
have
to
tell
me
twice."
"Ever
looked
up
to
a
yordle?"
"Come
on,
I'm
not
even
holding
the
controls!"
"Turbo
on!
Uh...
woah!
Just
needs
a
little
kick
start
there."
"Bandle
City...!
Oops,
forgot
the
clutch."
"Hot
hot
hot!
Oh!
Ah!
Hot
hot
hot
hot
hot!"
Rumble
panics.
Rumble
panics.
"Hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot!
Ooh,
aah!"
"Warning!"
