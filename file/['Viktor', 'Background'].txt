http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Viktor/Background
Early
in
life,
Viktor
discovered
his
passion
for
science
and
invention,
particularly
in
the
field
of
mechanical
automation.
He
attended
prestigious
College
of
Techmaturgy
and
led
the
team
that
constructed
,
a
scientific
breakthrough
that
he
expected
to
vault
him
to
the
top
of
his
profession.
Unfortunately
his
triumph
was
usurped
by
Professor
Stanwick,
who
stole
credit
for
developing
Blitzcrank's
sentience
and
later
used
Viktor's
research
to
revive
.
Viktor's
appeals
for
justice
fell
on
deaf
ears,
and
he
sank
into
a
deep
depression.
He
withdrew
from
the
College
and
barricaded
himself
in
his
private
laboratory,
cutting
all
human
ties.
There,
in
secret,
he
conceived
a
project
for
which
nobody
else
could
claim
credit.
Desiring
both
to
revolutionize
his
field
and
to
eliminate
the
jealous
human
emotions
which
festered
inside
him,
he
engineered
parts
to
replace
and
improve
his
own
body.
When
Viktor
re-emerged,
almost
no
trace
of
the
original
man
remained.
Not
only
had
he
supplanted
the
majority
of
his
anatomy,
but
his
personality
had
changed.
His
previous
hope
to
better
society
was
replaced
by
an
obsession
with
what
he
called
"the
glorious
evolution."
He
saw
himself
as
the
patron
and
pioneer
of
future,
a
future
in
which
man
would
renounce
his
flesh
in
favor
of
superior
hextech
augmentations.
Though
Viktor's
initial
appeals
were
met
with
heavy
skepticism,
scientists
were
confounded
by
the
sophistication
of
his
machinery.
By
integrating
his
mind
with
techmaturgical
devices,
he
had
been
able
to
drastically
accelerate
the
progress
of
his
research.
His
transformation
had
stripped
him
of
what
he
perceived
as
his
emotional
weaknesses,
but
there
was
some
lingering
residue
of
resentment
against
the
Professor.
Viktor
joined
to
pit
his
inventions
against
the
greatest
opponents
Valoran
could
offer,
and
to
correct
any
weaknesses
or
inefficiencies
that
remained.
Viktor
begins
to
speak
out
loud,
but
is
distracted
by
his
third
arm.
Viktor
was
discovered
ahead
of
his
announcement
by
examination
of
data
in
the
.
This
discovery
included
full
stats,
models,
and
backstory.
Announcement
made
in
the
Sneak
Peek
by
Average
Gatsby:
If
you’ve
ever
perused
a
book
on
ethics,
you
know
that
it’s
important
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due.
This
happens
to
be
especially
important
when
mad
scientists
are
involved.
Hypothetically,
if
you
were
to
construct
a
Great
Steam
Golem
only
to
find
that
some
other
scientific
type
had
claimed
your
creation
as
his
own,
it
might
cause
you
to
come
a
bit
more
unhinged.
Meet
Viktor,
the
Machine
Herald.
Not
only
is
he
the
scientist
who
invented
Blitzcrank,
but
he
also
had
his
creation
usurped
by
his
fiendish
professor.
Now,
people
cope
with
grief
in
different
ways.
Some
people
cry,
some
people
binge,
and
some
people
start
replacing
their
body
parts
with
robotic
limbs.
I
guess
we’ll
leave
it
up
to
you
to
decide
how
you
think
Viktor
deals
with
his
problems.
