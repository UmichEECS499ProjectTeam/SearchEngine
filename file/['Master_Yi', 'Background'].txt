The
goggles
Master
Yi
wears
are
a
techmaturgical
device
that
was
gifted
to
the
champion
by
own
.
Master
Yi
first
used
these
goggles
when
defending
his
homeland
from
Noxus
invaders
in
the
time
after
the
League
has
just
formed
and
before
Ionia
had
affiliated
itself
with
the
League.
The
goggles
are
fitted
specifically
for
Master
Yi;
while
someone
else
may
wear
them,
they
won't
receive
anywhere
near
the
same
benefit
as
he
does
himself.
The
one-of-a-kind
goggles,
known
as
the
"Seven
Lenses
of
Insight",
allow
Master
Yi
to
see
across
a
wider
range
of
the
spectrum
than
normal
people
see.
They
also
give
him
abilities
not
dissimilar
to
that
of
real
world
binoculars
and
telescopes.
The
goggles
are
synced
to
Yi's
own
magical
resonance,
allowing
him
to
adjust
settings
without
the
use
of
his
hands.
He
simply
thinks
what
he
needs,
and
the
goggles
act
accordingly.
Piltover's
"The
edge
of
the
sharpest
blade
is
no
match
for
the
calm
of
the
peaceful
mind."
―
"The
art
of
Wuju
lives
on
in
Master
Yi,
and
is
plunged
through
the
hearts
of
his
foes."
―
"My
blade
is
yours."
"This
will
be...
a
harsh
lesson."
"One
cut,
of
many."
"Observe."
"Defend
yourself."
"Blade
and
body."
"Never
await
victory."
"Let
us
begin."
"Anger
gives
motivation
without
purpose."
"In
me,
Wuju
lives
on."
"Form
before
strength."
"Wuju
style!"
"The
focused
mind
can
pierce
through
stone."
"Do
not
let
your
pride
blind
you."
"I
will
show
you
the
path."
"Doubt
is
the
greatest
enemy."
"A
true
master
is
an
eternal
student."
"Your
skills
are
inferior!"
"You
wish
to
learn
the
hard
way,
I
see."
"I
will
take
an
eye...
as
if
I
don't
have
enough
already."
"Pupil,
show
me
what
you
have
learned."
"Quit
monkeying
around!"
"Wuju..
pass
me
that
potion?"
"The
goggles?
Just
for
reading!"
"The
key
to
immortality?
Not
dying."
Master
Yi
laughs.
Master
Yi
laughs.
Master
Yi
laughs.
Master
Yi
laughs.
"Many
foes,
one
strike!"
"A
master
stroke!"
"Did
you
miss
it?"
"Mind
and
body."
"Shh
-
I'm
meditating!"'
"Look
inward."
"Speed
of
thought!"
"Keep
up!"
"So
fast."
"Watch,
and
learn."
"My
blade
is
yours."
"We
strike
now!
"Certainly."
"Do
not
fear
the
unknown."
"My
blade
is
yours."
"Wuju
style!"
"Follow
my
lead."
"I
will
show
you
the
path."
"A
wise
decision."
"Your
skills
are
inferior!"
"Wuju...
pass
me
that
potion?"

Summoners!
Any
League
of
Legends
player
will
tell
you
that
sometimes
the
jungle
on
Summoner’s
Rift
can
be
a
dangerous
place.
In
addition
to
all
of
those
wolves
and
lizards
and
golems,
if
you’re
not
careful
you
might
run
into
something
like
this
lurking
out
there
in
the
trees!
Allow
me
to
introduce
Headhunter
Master
Yi.
Featuring
some
menacing
new
armor
and
brand
new
spell
effects
on
both
Alpha
Strike
and
Wuju
Style,
this

one
rendition
of
the
Wuju
Bladesman
that
you
won’t
want
to
run
afoul
of
on
a
stroll
through
a
wooded
area.
You
may
want
to
steer
clear
of
the
jungle
for
a
while
if
you
want
to
stay
out
of
his
trophy
case!
Headhunter
Master
Yi
is
coming
soon
to
a
Field
of
Justice
near
you,
