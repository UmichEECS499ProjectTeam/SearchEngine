Fizz
the
Tidal
Trickster
or
Release
date
Fizz's
dexterity
allows
him
to
ignore
unit
collision
and
take
/
/
/
/
/
reduced
physical
damage
from
auto
attacks.
Additional
Information:
Fizz
dashes
a
fixed
distance
in
the
direction
of
the
target
enemy
unit,
dealing
physical
damage
and
magic
damage.
The
physical
damage
applies
on-hit
effects
and
the
magic
damage
applies
on-ability
effects.
Fizz's
auto
attacks
rend
his
target,
dealing
magic
damage
over
3
seconds
that
is
increased
based
on
a
percentage
of
the
target's
missing
health.
This
effect
does
not
stack
and
multiple
attacks
will
only
refresh
the
duration.
The
total
damage
caps
at
300
against
minions
and
monsters
(100
damage
per
second).
Fizz's
auto
attacks
are
empowered
for
the
next
5
seconds,
dealing
additional
magic
damage
on-hit
and
applying
for
3
seconds.
Additional
Information:
Fizz
hops
onto
his
trident
in
a
nearby
location,
becoming
untargetable
for
0.
seconds
and
gaining
the
ability
to
use
Trickster
before
the
effect
ends.
If
Fizz
does
not
use
Trickster,
he
will
slam
the
ground
below
him,
dealing
magic
damage
and
slowing
nearby
enemies
within
330
range
for
2
seconds.
Fizz
hops
off
from
his
trident
to
a
nearby
location,
dealing
magic
damage
to
nearby
enemies
within
270
range.
Trickster
does
not
apply
a
slow.
Additional
Information:
Fizz
throws
a
fish
in
a
line
that
will
bind
itself
onto
the
first
enemy
champion
it
hits.
If
it
doesn't
hit
an
enemy
champion
it
will
stay
on
an
area,
and
it
will
stick
to
the
first
enemy
champion
that
walks
into
the
area.
The
fish
will
slow
and
reveal
any
enemy
champion
it
is
attached
to.
Regardless
of
position,
after
1.
seconds,
a
Shark
will
come
out
from
the
earth
to
eat
the
fish.
If
a
champion
has
the
fish
attached
to
them
they
are
knocked
up
for
1
second.
All
other
enemies
within
250
range
are
knocked
away
from
the
shark.
All
enemies
hit
are
dealt
magic
damage
and
are
slowed
for
1.
seconds
afterwards.
