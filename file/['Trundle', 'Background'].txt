"I've
learned
a
thing
or
two
about
pain!
Let
me
show
you!"
―
"Time
to
troll!"
"Smashing!"
"I'll
show
them
frostbite."
"This
will
only
hurt...
a
lot!"
"C'mon,
entertain
me."
"They
crossed
the
wrong
troll."
"Tonight,
I'm
feeling
greedy."
"You
can
never
bash
something
too
many
times."
"I'm
gonna
knock
'em
dead."
"Nobody
trespasses
in
my
town."
"They're
ruining
my
good
mood!"
"Woops!
Did
I
break
something?"
"I'm
the
troll
with
the
plan."
"Time
to
start
an
ice
age."
"I
like
my
human
with
a
bit
of
spice."
"The
Freljord
is
mine!"
"I'm
troll
judge,
troll
jury,
and
execu...
troll!"
"King
of
trolls,
coming
through."
"I'm
not
ugly,
but
they're
about
to
be!"
"Ohoho,
they
look
angry!"
"Not
troll
chief,
troll
king.
King!"
"The
trolls
are
going
to
war!"
"I'm
gonna
crush
your
dreams...
They're
in
your
skull,
right?"
"You
got
a
problem
with
me?
Join
the
club!"
"If
you
want
me
to
hit
you
less,
die
sooner!"
"Have
you
seen
this
thing?
Like
really
close."
"Troll
with
the
biggest
club
gets
to
be
king.
That's
the
rule!"
"It's
alright
Clubbems,
we'll
get
to
smashing
soon."
Trundle
laughs.

"This
is
troll
town!"
"You're
in
MY
kingdom
now!"
"Shrivel!"
"Bow
down!"
"Pathetic!"
"Trollmacia!"
"C'mere,
princess."
"Whiny
cub!"
"Run,
Ashe!"
"Hahaha.
Sunlight?
Really?"
"Squeal!"
"Who
does
this
guy
think
he
is?"
"But
I...
Troll
king..."
"Share
the
agony!"
"Time
to
troll!"
"Let's
go
clubbing."
"Suffer
as
I
do."
"Smash
through
the
pain."
"This
is
about
to
get
ugly!"
"It
never
stops."
"I'm
on
it."
"The
tribe
is
waiting."
"Let's
smash
something!"
"I'm
not
heartless.
I
beating."
"Oww,
splinter!"
"Let's
show
'em
my
ugly
side."
"If
you
want
me
to
hit
you
less,
die
sooner."
"Defeat
Trundle?
Are
you
trolling?"
"How
much
you
wanna
bet
I
can
whack
you
from
one
fountain
to
the
other?"
"Don't
hate
the
player,
hate
the
club
that's
smashin'
your
face!"

Trundle
was
designed
by
Champions
in
the
League
of
Legends
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes.
Whether
you're
a
fan
of
huge,
hulking,
stone
giants;
sinister,
lithe
femme
fatales;
awesome,
mighty
warriors;
or
aberrant,
horrific
creatures,
we
try
to
represent
them
all
under
one
roof.
And
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
aberrant,
horrific
creatures,
allow
me
to
give
you
a
glimpse
of
our
next
champion.
Meet
Trundle,
the
Cursed
Troll.
He's
hideous,
and
very
possibly
diseased,
so
he
wanted
me
to
let
you
know
that
you
shouldn't
judge
a
book
by
its
cover.
Unless,
of
course,
that
cover
is
snarling
and
wielding
a
club.
Then
you
might
be
onto
something.
What's
this...?
Is
this...
a
troll?
What's
a
troll
doing
in
the
Freljord?
Are
we...
trolling
you?
On
a
more
serious
note,
some
of
you
will
probably
guess
that
if
there's
a
troll
and
he's
wielding
a
club...
it's
Trundle!
So
we
wanted
to
give
you
a
taste
of
what's
to
come,
namely
Trundle's
relaunch
and
his
reimagining
in
the
icy
north.
While
old
Trundle
certainly
had
a
unique
narrative
and
visual
design,
we
always
felt
he
was
disconnected
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
This
inhibited
the
number
of
stories
we
could
tell
with
Trundle
and,
well,
we
want
to
tell
stories
about
him.
Trundle's
upcoming
changes
include
a
gameplay
update
(more
of
a
quality
improvement
than
a
rework
–
similar
in
scope
to
our
Taric
changes
in
3.03),
a
new
ice-themed
aesthetic
(if
you
couldn't
guess),
and
a
new
story
that
ties
Trundle
to
the
brewing
conflict
in
the
Freljord.
Stay
tuned
in
the
coming
weeks,
because
we've
got
plans
for
Trundle
–
not
to
mention
that
Trundle
has
plans
of
his
own!
You'll
have
to
wait
to
hear
more,
but
here's
something
to
tide
you
over.
As
with
Karma's
relaunch,
anyone
who
owns
Trundle
before
his
relaunch
will
get
this
Traditional
Trundle
(has
a
nice
ring
to
it)
skin
for
free:
