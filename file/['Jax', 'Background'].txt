There
are
times
when
a
champion’s
intimidating
visage
is
so
bloodcurdling
that
his
icy
stare
can
leave
an
enemy
quaking
in
his
Boots
of
Speed.
If
you’ve
been
on
the
lookout
for
a
truly
threatening
take
on
the
Grandmaster
at
Arms,
you’ll
be
pleased
to
know
that
Nemesis
Jax
is
armed
and
ready
to
leap
into
the
fray.
With
an
imposing
new
model
that
sports
a
steel
mask,
flowing
cape
and
wicked-looking
mace,
this
is
one
champion
your
enemies
won’t
want
to
face
top
lane.
