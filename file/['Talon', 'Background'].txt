Talon's
earliest
memories
are
the
darkness
of
underground
passages
and
the
reassuring
steel
of
a
blade.
He
remembers
no
family,
warmth,
or
kindness.
Instead,
the
clink
of
stolen
gold
and
the
security
of
a
wall
at
his
back
are
all
the
kinship
he
has
ever
craved.
Kept
alive
only
by
his
quick
wits
and
deft
thievery,
Talon
scraped
out
a
living
in
the
seedy
underbelly
of
Noxus.
His
mastery
of
the
blade
quickly
marked
him
as
a
threat,
and
Noxian
guilds
sent
assassins
to
him
with
a
demand:
join
their
ranks
or
be
killed.
He
left
the
bodies
of
his
pursuers
dumped
in
Noxus'
moat
as
his
response.
The
assassination
attempts
grew
increasingly
dangerous
until
one
assailant
met
Talon
blade-for-blade
in
a
match
of
strength.
To
his
surprise,
Talon
was
disarmed
and
facing
down
his
executioner's
sword
when
the
assassin
revealed
himself
to
be
General
Du
Couteau.
The
General
offered
Talon
the
choice
between
death
at
his
hand,
or
life
as
an
agent
of
the
Noxian
High
Command.
Talon
chose
life,
on
the
condition
that
his
service
was
to
Du
Couteau
alone,
for
the
only
type
of
orders
he
could
respect
were
from
one
he
could
not
defeat.
Talon
remained
in
the
shadows,
carrying
out
secret
missions
on
Du
Couteau's
orders
that
took
him
from
the
frigid
lands
of
to
the
inner
sanctums
of
.
When
the
general
vanished,
Talon
considered
reclaiming
his
freedom,
but
he
had
gained
immense
respect
from
Du
Couteau
after
years
in
his
service.
He
became
obsessed
with
tracking
down
the
general's
whereabouts.
Talon's
suspicions
led
him
to
the
doors
of
,
where
he
joined
in
order
to
find
those
responsible
for
Du
Couteau's
disappearance.

It

a

style,

a
man

and
cowled
assassin
that
he
is,
Talon's
cloak

makes
him
a

and
terrifying
presence
on
the
battlefield.
It's
probably
best
to
steer
clear
of
this
cloaked
and
dangerous
champion
on
the
Field
of
Justice,
or
he
won't
be
the
only
one
pulling
a
disappearing
act.
Greetings,
Summoners!
Today
we
wanted
to
bring
you
a
peek
into
the
mechanics
behind
Talon,
the
Blade's
Shadow,
the
new
assassin
that's
joining
the
League!
Talon,
the
Blade's
Shadow,
is
a
physical
damage
assassin
who
specializes
in
high-mobility,
high-risk,
high-reward
gameplay.
Our
goal
with
Talon
was
to
create
a
powerful
but
fragile
melee
character
with
specialized
tools
to
make
him
both
deadly
and
evasive.
As
a
result,
what
Talon
lacks
in
durability
and
sustain,
he
dishes
out
in
mobility
and
power.
The
driving
force
behind
Talon's
gameplay
is
the
way
that
he
engages
and
disengages
from
combat
using
his
four
abilities:
Cutthroat:
An
ability
that
allows
Talon
to
catch
his
enemies
by
surprise.
Talon
leaps
behind
his
target
and
silences
them
for
a
short
duration,
amplifying
the
damage
of
any
of
his
follow
up
attacks
and
abilities.
Noxian
Diplomacy:
Talon
viciously
stabs
his
enemy,
dealing
heavy
physical
damage
and
causing
them
to
leave
a
blood
trail
that
Talon
can
use
to
track
them.
Rake:
Talon
fans
out
three
blades
in
front
of
him
that
quickly
return
to
him,
dealing
damage
and
slowing
any
target
hit
in
either
direction.
Shadow
Assault
(Ultimate):
Talon
enters
stealth
for
a
short
duration,
gaining
a
movement
speed
boost
and
sending
blades
that
deal
damage
to
all
enemies
in
their
path
flying
in
every
direction.
Once
the
blades
reach
a
certain
distance,
they
pause
and
form
a
circle.
When
Talon
reappears
from
stealth,
the
blades
return
to
him,
once
again
dealing
damage
to
any
opponent
they
pass
through.
Mercy
(Innate):
Talon's
auto-attacks
deal
additional
damage
to
a
target
that
is
under
the
influence
of
any
crowd
control
effect.
Playing
Talon
effectively
is
all
about
reading
the
situation
and
reacting
strategically
to
your
target.
Shadow
Assault
can
be
either
your
saving
grace
or
your
deadliest
advance.
Using
it
to
disappear
can
sting
your
target
and
leave
them
chasing
ghosts.
But
if
it's
a
fight
you
want,
using
it
to
initiate
in
conjuction
with
Cutthroat,
Noxian
Diplomacy,
and
Mercy
can
deal
significant
burst
damage.
To
sum
up,
Talon's
a
mean,
shadowy,
vicious
assassin...
and
we're
excited
to
see
him
join
the
League
soon.
And
as
a
side
note,
his
mobility
and
elusiveness
makes
him
a
very
good
pick
on
Dominion!
