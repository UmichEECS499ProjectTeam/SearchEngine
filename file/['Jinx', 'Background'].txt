Jinx
lives
to
wreak
havoc
without
a
thought
for
consequence,
leaving
a
trail
of
mayhem
and
panic
in
her
wake.
A
manic
and
impulsive
criminal,
she
despises
nothing
more
than
boredom,
and
gleefully
unleashes
her
own
volatile
brand
of
pandemonium
to
the
one
place
she
finds
dullest:
.
With
an
arsenal
of
deadly
toys,
she
unleashes
the
brightest
explosions
and
loudest
blasts
-
all
the
better
to
shock
and
surprise
the
hapless
authorities.
Always
just
out
of
the
law's
reach,
Jinx's
favorite
game
is
to
toy
with
Piltover's
finest
-
especially
.
Piltover
had
long
been
known
as
the
City
of
Progress,
a
place
where
peace
and
order
reigned.
That
serenity
was
challenged
when
a
new
kind
of
criminal
arrived,
the
likes
of
whom
had
never
been
seen.
This
mysterious
outlaw
unleashed
a
series
of
warped
and
destructive
capers
that
endangered
the
entire
city,
and
left
its
people
reeling
from
the
worst
crime
spree
in
Piltover's
history.
As
the
string
of
crimes
without
rhyme
or
reason
hit
the
city,
sightings
of
the
lawbreaker
emerged.
Though
the
young
woman's
origins
were
a
mystery,
some
saw
traces
of
Piltover
hextech
in
her
firearms,
while
others
described
the
street
fashions
of
in
her
dress.
Because
her
arrival
always
brought
trouble
with
it,
those
who
crossed
her
path
soon
gave
her
a
name:
Jinx.
Jinx's
rampage
escalated.
-
the
sheriff
of
Piltover
-
responded
by
declaring
a
state
of
emergency
and
organizing
a
city-wide
manhunt.
In
typical
Jinx
fashion,
the
criminal
marked
the
Piltover
treasury,
the
city's
most
secure
building,
with
a
direct
challenge
to
its
most
abrasive
officer.
With
a
caricature
of
Vi's
face
splashed
across
the
treasury's
facade,
and
with
a
time
and
date
of
her
supposed
raid,
Jinx
was
openly
daring
the
enforcer
to
stop
her
from
robbing
it.
Determined
to
put
the
troublemaker
behind
bars,
Vi
watched
and
waited
outside
the
treasury
until
Jinx's
time
had
finally
come.
True
to
her
scrawled
promise,
the
smiling
menace
showed
her
face.
Knowing
this
was
her
chance
to
capture
the
outlaw,
Vi
gave
chase
into
the
building's
interior.
She
smashed
through
wall
after
wall
to
chase
down
Jinx,
who
giggled
as
she
lit
up
the
evacuated
treasury
with
fiery
explosions.
Vi
finally
cornered
the
criminal
inside
the
vault,
but
Jinx
wasn't
done
just
yet.
With
a
maniacal
laugh,
she
fired
a
barrage
of
rockets,
bringing
the
entire
building
down
upon
them
both.
Jinx
pulls
out
and
mimics
talking
with
him
like
a
puppet.
Jinx
falls
to
the
ground
and
starts
giggling
hysterically.
Announcement
made
by
Jinx
introduced
herself
to
the
League
of
Legends
community
by
vandalizing
various
pages
on
the
League
of
Legends
website.
Rough
translation
of
her
graffiti
on
the
LA
website:
Piltover
Zaun
When
Vi
finally
crawled
out
of
the
ruins,
the
battered
enforcer
found
no
trace
of
Jinx.
Adding
insult
to
injury,
not
a
single
ounce
of
gold
had
been
taken
from
the
ruined
vault.
Instead,
the
criminal
left
a
parting
message
to
her
favorite
officer
of
the
law
-
a
challenge
only
now
visible
through
the
gaping
opening
in
Piltover's
skyline.
The
lights
of
the
city
spelled
out
a
simple
taunt:
you'll
never
catch
me.
As
Vi
read
the
message,
she
heard
the
distant
laughter
of
her
new
nemesis,
and
the
city
plunged
into
utter
darkness
for
the
very
first
time.
―
The
name’s
Vi.
I’m
an
enforcer.
And
this
is
my
town
-
.
They
call
this
place
the
City
of
Progress
-
or
they
did
until
she
showed
up.
Permanently.
―
The
terms
here
referred
are
tasted
by
my
cultured
tongue
over
and
over
again,
as
a
sweet
snack,
with
real
linguistic
passion.
The
writer,
tastes
the
words
with
pleasure
,
biting
them
with
the
teeth
,
to
soften
them
with
finesse
and
discretion
until,
harmoniously,
every
word
bleeds
and
so
I
can
get
conclusions
,
which
if
everyone
approves
or
not
is
subject
to
a
treaty
that
my
leisure
doesn't
let
me
write,
because
the
bone
of
literary
hedonism
lies
in
the
flavour
of
all
the
things
and
not
in
their
way
through
the
digestive
tract
(of
the
most
chaotic
chaos).
Of
course,
that
is
just
my
humble
opinion.
However,
in
this
3rd
post,
I
invite
the
reader
to
think
of
the
word...

look

I'm

Oh
wait
-
it's
empty!

Or

"Stay
still!
I'm

"I'll
give

the
count
of

time's
up!"
"Duck!
Hehe,
just
kidding,
that
won't
help."
"Gotta'

sometime!"

It's
called
gun

"Any
last
words?
Ha!
No,
just
die."
"Seriously,
screaming
helps...
not
at
all."
"No
need
to
be
scared
-
or
alive."
"You're
starting
to
bore
me."
"I
accidentally
did
that
on
purpose."
"You're
my
favorite
waste
of
bullets."
"You're
not
laughing."
"Tcha-tcha-tcha-tcha!"
"Katchoo!"
"Everybody,
panic!"
"I
feel
like
I
forgot
to
shoot
something..."
"Scream
along
if
you

the

"I've
got
a
recital,
and
everyone's
invited!"
"Who
wants
a
solo?"
"Let's
just
behave...
said
no
one,
ever."
"Wait,
I'm

Urgh...
how
do
people
do
this?"

but
I
just
can't!"
"Jinx?
Stands
for
Jinx!
Durr."
"Whatever,
let's
just
start
shooting!"
"Now
where
was
I?
Oh,
right,
wreaking
havoc!"
"Hold
on!
I'm
about
to
say
something
really
cool!"
"Ask
me
if
I'm
listening!
Hint:
I'm
not!"
"I
don't
even

once
about
blowing
stuff
up!"

such
a
loser,
always
ready

cry!'
T-t-t-ta!"

think
I'm

You
should
see

have

For

"Bullets!"
"Who
needs
reasons?"
"I'm
crazy!
Got

note."
"All
part

I
just
made
up!"
"What
if
I
had
a

that
shot
other

"Aww,
c'mon,
what's
the
worst

could
happen?"
"I
really
need
a
new
gun.
But
don't
tell
my
other
guns."
"What's
in
my
violin
case?
Violence."
"Guns
don't
kill
people.
I
mean,
until
you
shoot
them.
Then
they
kill
everything!"
"I'm
bringing
guns
to
the
knife
fight!
Hehe."
"Say
hello
to
my
friends
of
varying
sizes!"
"Three
guns
means
never
having
to
say
'I'm
sorry'."
"Welcome
to
Snoresville,
hat
lady!
Population:
you."
"But
where
are
your
other
guns,
hat
lady?"
"You're
gonna
chase
me,
fat
hands?"
"Vi?
stands
for
stupid!"
"I'm
over
here,
fat
hands!"
"Hey
Fishbones,
should
we
blow
something
up?
'You
might
inconvenience
people
and
hurt
their
feelings.'
You're
the
worst
weapon
ever!"
"Fishbones,
you
know
what
we
oughta'
do?
'Do
the
laundry,
wash
dishes
and
pay
some
bills.'
Stupid
dumb
rocket
launcher."
"Hey
Fishbones,
think
we
can
wreak
havoc
forever?
'No,
you
should
buy
a
home
and
save
for
retirement.'
You
know
I
can
replace
you,
right?"
"Maybe
we
should
settle
down
and
live
peaceful
lives.
'Really?
I
always
hoped
one
day
you'd-'
Haha,
nope!
You're
a
death
machine
for
life!"
Jinx
laughs.
Jinx
laughs.
Jinx
laughs.
Jinx
laughs.
"Zap!"
"Drink
up!"
"Pop
the
cork!"
"See
ya!"
"Bye
bye!"
"Watch
this!"
"Catch!"
"That
really
hurt...
my
feelings."
"That
was
almost
not
close
at
all!"
"Three,
forty-one,
nine
and
lift
off!"
"I'll
be
right
back!
No
one
die
screaming
without
me!"
"They...
got
me..."
"Awww..."
While
Jinx
finishes
loading
Pow-Pow
and
Fishbones
for
her
debut
on
the
battlefield,
we
wanted
to
share
one
more
glimpse
into
her
chaotic
personality.
For
Jinx,
the
fun
doesn't
end
just
because
she's
sleeping.
