There
is
no
greater
symbol
of
might
than
Darius,
the
nation's
most
feared
and
battle-hardened
warrior.
Orphaned
at
a
young
age,
Darius
had
to
fight
to
keep
himself
and
his
alive.
By
the
time
he
joined
the
military,
he
had
already
developed
the
strength
and
discipline
of
a
veteran
soldier.
The
first
true
test
of
Darius'
resolve
occurred
in
a
crucial
battle
against
,
where
the
Noxian
forces
were
exhausted
and
outnumbered.
Darius'
captain
called
for
his
troops
to
retreat,
but
Darius
refused
to
accept
such
an
act
of
cowardice.
Breaking
formation,
Darius
strode
towards
the
captain
and
decapitated
him
with
one
sweep
of
his
gigantic
axe.
Both
terrified
and
inspired,
the
soldiers
followed
Darius
into
battle
and
fought
with
incredible
strength
and
fervor.
After
a
long
and
grueling
battle,
they
ultimately
emerged
victorious.
Seizing
momentum
from
this
victory,
Darius
led
his
now
fiercely
loyal
troops
in
a
devastating
campaign
against
Demacia.
After
proving
his
power
on
the
battlefield,
Darius
turned
his
gaze
homeward.
He
saw
a
Noxus
riddled
with
weakness,
where
greedy,
complacent
nobles
drained
the
nation's
strength.
Seeking
to
restore
his
country
to
greatness,
Darius
took
it
upon
himself
to
reshape
the
Noxian
leadership.
He
identified
weak
figureheads
and
violently
removed
them
from
their
positions
of
power.
Many
in
Noxus
saw
Darius'
cull
as
an
attempt
to
seize
power,
but
he
had
a
different
plan
for
the
throne.
He
had
been
watching
the
rise
of
with
keen
interest.
In
Swain,
Darius
saw
a
leader
with
the
mind
and
determination
to
bring
Noxus
to
glory.
Now
allied
with
the
Master
Tactician,
Darius
works
to
unite
the
nation
behind
his
vision
of
true
Noxian
strength.
Darius
spins
his
axe
around
him,
but
becomes
dizzy.

"If
you've
ever
been
frustrated
by
your
progress
in
a
given
position,
you
might
want
to
look
to
Darius,
the
Hand
of
Noxus,
for
inspiration.
In
order
to
secure
his
own
advancement,
this
determined
champion
has
repeatedly
employed
the
foolproof
method
of
lopping
his
boss'
head
off.
So
whether
you
believe
that
the
road
to
power
is
paved
with
the
headless
bodies
of
your
enemies,
or
you
simply
think
that
a
good
beheading
is
a
rather
expedient
method
of
dealing
with
red
tape,
we
think
that
you'll
agree
that
Darius
makes
a
fine
addition
to
the
League
of
Legends."

"If
you're
fond
of
cutting
a
swath
through
your
enemies
on
the
way
to
scoring
that
epic
killing
blow,
look
no
further
than
Darius,
the
Hand
of
Noxus.
This
focused
and
deadly
warrior
specializes
in
focused
attacks
and
attrition
damage,
closing
out
his
assault
with
heavy
damage
nukes.
At
the
heart
of
Darius'
kit
is
his
passive
ability:
Hemorrhage.
Darius'
basic
attacks
and
damaging
abilities
all
cause
the
target
to
bleed
for
additional
damage
over
time.
This
effect
can
stack
up
to
five
times,
also
giving
Darius
some
bonus
movement
speed
for
each
enemy
champion
currently
afflicted
and
granting
his
other
abilities
additional
effects.
In
team
fights,
Darius
can
start
off
by
using
Decimate
to
quickly
apply
his
bleed
on
a
number
of
enemies.
These
Hemorrhage
debuffs
will
not
only
give
him
a
hefty
movement
speed
bonus,
but
also
interact
with
his
other
abilities
for
added
effect.
To
pursue
a
fleeing
enemy,
the
added
speed
from
his
passive
combines
with
Crippling
Slash,
an
attack
that
slows
the
opponent
and
refunds
part
of
the
cooldown
for
each
stack
of
Hemorrhage
currently
affecting
the
target.
Even
in
the
event
an
adversary
should
start
to
slip
away,
Darius
can
use
Apprehend
to
pull
them
back
within
reach.
Finally,
to
close
out
this
relentless
assault
in
an
appropriately
brutal
manner,
Darius
can
employ
his
ultimate
ability,
Noxian
Guillotine.
Leaping
forward,
Darius
strikes
a
lethal
blow
that
deals
true
damage
plus
a
hefty
bonus
for
each
stack
of
Hemorrhage
currently
applied.
Additionally,
if
Darius
scores
a
killing
blow
in
the
process,
the
cooldown
on
Noxian
Guillotine
is
immediately
refunded.
This
allows
him
to
redouble
and
continue
his
bloody
work
on
an
additional
opponent
(or
opponents,
as
the
case
may
be).
Watching
this
vicious
champion
dart
through
the
fray,
decapitating
foe
after
foe
in
rapid
succession
can
be
a
truly
terrifying
and
epic
sight!"
