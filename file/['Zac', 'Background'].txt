Zac
is
the
product
of
a
experiment
to
manufacture
a
hexchem-engineered
supersoldier
–
the
Zaun
Amorphous
Combatant.
Combining
brute
strength
with
limitless
flexibility,
he
is
a
versatile
juggernaut:
a
creative
fighter
who
bounces
over
obstacles
and
pounds
his
foes
into
submission.
Though
he
was
created
inside
a
weapons
laboratory,
Zac
was
rescued
and
adopted
by
two
loving
parents
who
raised
him
to
be
a
kind
and
friendly
child.
As
the
years
passed,
he
grew
up
to
be
a
fierce
hero,
sworn
to
protect
the
ordinary,
everyday
people
of
Zaun.
Long
ago,
two
Zaun
scientists
developed
an
organic
substance
that
could
withstand
extreme
conditions,
spontaneously
alter
its
biological
structure,
and
generate
tremendous
amounts
of
kinetic
force.
As
the
scientists,
husband
and
wife,
watched
the
prototype
grow
from
a
spoon-sized
droplet
to
a
small
blob,
they
noticed
that
their
creation
would
respond
to
their
presence.
It
sprung
forward
when
they
called
and
bounced
when
they
sang.
The
couple
began
to
see
more
than
an
experiment;
they
saw
a
small
child,
filled
with
affection
and
joy.
After
testing
the
prototype
one
evening,
the
scientists
placed
the
blob
back
in
its
cage.
It
slouched
and
shuddered
in
the
corner,
inconsolably
sad.
At
that
moment,
the
couple
realized
that
their
beloved
creation
wished
for
a
free
life
outside
the
lab.
They
were
struck
by
their
conscience
and
could
not
allow
the
prototype
to
be
used
as
a
weapon.
The
husband
and
wife
fled
with
the
young
blob,
replacing
its
weapon
designation
–
Zaun
Amorphous
Combatant
–
with
a
proper
name:
Zac.
In
a
quiet
neighborhood
far
from
the
cities
of
Zaun,
the
scientists
raised
Zac
as
their
own
child.
Zac
was
always
different
from
the
other
children.
None
had
his
powers
of
strength
and
flexibility,
so
the
couple
taught
him
to
tell
right
from
wrong
and
to
use
his
gifts
responsibly.
Thanks
to
the
care
and
affection
of
his
loving
parents,
Zac
lived
a
peaceful,
happy
childhood.
That
childhood
ended
when
the
Zaun
laboratory
finally
found
Zac.
Unable
to
replicate
the
formula
used
to
create
the
amorphous
prototype,
the
laboratory's
staff
never
stopped
searching
for
the
scientists
and
their
experiment.
When
they
tracked
down
the
family,
they
threatened
to
tear
it
apart.
The
staff
abducted
Zac's
parents
and
demanded
that
the
couple
assist
in
his
capture
and
return.
Seized
by
the
fear
of
losing
his
freedom
and
his
parents,
Zac
unleashed
every
ounce
of
his
raw
energy
and
mass
for
the
very
first
time.
He
subdued
his
parents'
captors,
sent
the
laboratory's
workers
fleeing,
and
brought
his
loved
ones
home.
From
then
on,
Zac
vowed
to
defend
all
ordinary
lives
threatened
by
extraordinary
treachery
and
wickedness.
Originally
built
to
destroy,
he
now
protects
the
innocent
and
the
helpless.

Zac,
the
League's
hexchem-fueled
Secret
Weapon
is
about
to
hit
the
Fields
of
Justice.
Playing
this
gelatinous
champion
means
striking
a
balance
between
health-cost
abilities
and
a
unique
regeneration
mechanic.
Here's
your
first
look
at
what
this
blob's
amorphous
abilities
bring
to
the
table.
Zac's
AoE
damage
and
self-healing
skills
provide
him
with
a
lot
of
flexibility
on
the
battlefield.
His
high
level
of
sustainability
makes
him
an
ideal
choice
whether
you're
tearing
through
the
jungle
or
trading
hits
in
top
lane.
Zac's
combination
of
area
damage
and
healing
makes
him
a
natural
jungler.
If
you're
partial
to
early
game
aggression,
starting
with
an
early
lizard
buff
and
spending
your
second
skill
point
in
Elastic
Slingshot
can
open
early
gank
opportunities.
Since
Zac's
abilities
have
no
mana
cost,
you
might
also
consider
donating
an
early
golem
buff
to
your
AP
carry.
Once
the
action
starts
ramping
up,
you
can
make
use
of
Elastic
Slingshot's
massive
range
to
create
sneaky
gank
opportunities
by
circumventing
popular
ward
locations.
Zac's
skillset
also
makes
him
excel
in
top
lane.
His
AoE
presence
allows
you
to
quickly
clear
waves
from
your
turrets
in
high-pressure
situations
or
shove
the
lane
when
you're
on
the
offensive.
The
healing
mechanic
on
Cell
Division
also
helps
win
exchanges
with
your
lane
opponent,
allowing
you
to
bully
enemies
back
to
base
and
create
opportunities
for
counter-jungling
or
ganks.
While
you're
roaming,
the
mobility
afforded
by
Elastic
Slingshot
can
help
you
get
the
drop
on
an
unsuspecting
enemy
or
escape
from
sticky
situations
by
hopping
over
terrain.
As
the
game
progresses,
Zac's
extreme
mobility
and
strong
crowd
control
make
him
a
tremendous
asset
in
team
fights.
With
some
patience
and
setup,
you
can
use
a
fully
channeled
Elastic
Slingshot
to
deploy
Let's
Bounce!
from
huge
distances.
Once
you're
in
the
thick
of
it,
the
additional
bounces
from
your
ultimate
let
you
pressure
fragile,
high-value
targets,
disrupting
enemy
positioning
as
you
draw
fire
off
less
durable
allies.
Since
every
bounce
of
your
ultimate
yields
healing
chunks,
you'll
also
have
the
sustainability
you
need
to
keep
up
the
attack.
If
the
opposing
team
making
aggressive
moves,
you
can
opt
to
use
the
knock-up
and
slow
from
Let's
Bounce!
defensively,
creating
valuable
space
for
the
rest
of
your
team
to
safely
disengage.
Whether
you're
initiating
or
counter-initiating,
Zac
has
ample
crowd
control
to
keep
your
team
out
of
trouble.
