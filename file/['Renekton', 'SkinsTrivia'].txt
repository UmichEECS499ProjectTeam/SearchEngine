Renekton
was
designed
by
.
Renekton
is
voiced
by
,
who
also
voices
,
and
.
Renekton
was
first
revealed
in
the
Journal
of
Justice,
Volume
1
Issue
8,
as
the
brother
of
,
though
his
name
was
spelled
Renekhton
there.
It
should
be
noted
however
that
Renekton
has
technically
been
in
the
lore
as
long
as
Nasus
has,
as
the
story
of
the
conflict
between
the
two
brothers
has
been
in
Nasus's
backstory
from
the
start.
His
title
was
previously
,
but
was
changed
to
the
current
title
by
after
his
sneak
peek.
was
originally
called
Tyrantâ€™s
Reach
but
was
changed
with
the
release
of
the
Champion
Spotlight
for
unknown
reasons.
Renekton's
Art
Spotlight
is
the
only
one
that
is
not
of
his
original
skin,
but
his
Outback
skin.
Renekton
and
both
bear
resemblance
to
old
Egyptian
Gods,
namely
and
.
However,
Renekton's
lore
is
more
resemblant
of
,
a
half-crocodile
demon
that,
upon
Anubis's
judgment
of
a
heart
being
impure,
would
eat
the
heart
of
the
impure
one.
This
is
similar
to
Renekton's
judgment
of
who
was
worthy
of
receiving
Nasus'
teachings.
In
his
lore,
it
states
that
he
awakens
in
the
sewers
of
.
This
is
a
reference
to
the
urban
legend
that
crocodiles
live
in
the
sewers
of
various
large
cities.
Renekton's
blade-weapon
may
be
a
reference
to
the
Klingon
bat'leth,
from
the
Star
Trek
series.
Although,
Renekton's
blade
has
the
grips
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
blade
where
as
a
traditional
bat'leth
has
them
on
the
outside
edge
of
the
blade.
Thus
it
could
be
a
reference
to
the
protagonist's
weapon
in
the
Manhwa
Jackals,
weapon
that
can
be
seen
in
the
front.
Renekton
references
in
his
in-game
quotes.
He
is
one
of
the
few
champions
who
references
another
champion
in-game.
Because
Renekton
uses
the
system,
his
spells
don't
cost
any
,
or
life
to
be
used.
The
fury
gained
through
attacks
is
used
to
empower
them
only.
The
icon
for
Renekton's
is
similar
to
the
icon
for
's
.
His
ability
"Slice
and
Dice"
makes
reference
to
cut
something
into
small
pieces
to
analyze
it,
and
is
another
reference
to
"blind
violence".
Like
his
brother's
ultimate
,
Renekton's
ultimate
makes
him
bigger,
gives
him
more
health,
and
damages
surrounding
enemies.
In
the
Polish
version,
Renekton's
/joke
and
/taunt
are
both
quotes
from
that's
popular
in
Poland.
It
is
worth
noting,
however,
that
curse
words
are
substituted
with
their
less
offensive
counterparts.
Renekton
shares
a
quote
with
:
.
Renekton's
taunt
makes
reference
to
in
Egyptian
lore.
The
quote
"Come
back
when
you've
collected
all
the
bits
of
yourself"
makes
double
reference:
one
to
the
champion
he
kills
and
one
to
the
lore
of
the
egyptian
gods,
since
Osiris
needed
to
recover
all
his
body
parts
in
order
to
return
and
claim
his
position
as
a
true
god.
Renekton's
joke
refers
to
the
birds
that
are
usually
found
on
alligator
mouths
cleaning
them
from
food
remains.
Outback
Renekton
skin
is
a
reference
to
.
Galactic
Renekton
and
skins
are
most
likely
a
reference
to
the
Egyptian
gods
of
the
Stargate
series.
While
standing
in
brush
with
the
Bloodfury
Renekton
skin,
his
tongue
will
sometimes
remain
opaque
while
the
rest
of
his
body
is
translucent.
This
does
not
affect
detection
from
outside
the
brush.

resembance

from
the
World
of
