As
a
child,
Veigar
was
a
normal
yordle
with
one
small
exception
-
he
had
a
deep
curiosity
for
the
world
beyond
.
The
young
yordle
spent
much
of
his
time
studying
the
rest
of
Valoran,
and
he
jumped
at
the
chance
to
join
a
business
that
traded
with
other
major
city-states.
Unfortunately
for
both
him
and
the
world,
a
deal
with
Noxian
traders
turned
into
shady
business
and
went
bad;
Veigar
and
his
companions
were
subsequently
set
up
to
take
the
fall.
Arrested
by
the
authorities,
he
was
imprisoned
within
the
walls
of
for
years.
Such
isolation
is
very
dangerous
for
yordles
-
undoubtedly
why
his
cruel
jailers
did
such
a
thing
-
and
Veigar
was
slowly
driven
mad.
He
eventually
escaped,
having
become
a
twisted
version
of
his
former
self.
Instead
of
returning
to
his
people
and
Bandle
City,
he
sought
tutelage
from
dark
wizards
across
the
land.
With
his
demented
will
focused
on
one
task,
he
quickly
became
a
dangerous
and
powerful
wizard
in
his
own
right.
Now
he
seeks
to
end
all
conflict
on
Valoran
by
bringing
all
of
the
city-states
to
their
knees,
regardless
of
their
affiliation.
is
the
perfect
tool
to
help
him
meet
his
ends
-
for
now.

To
most,
thoughts
of
do
not
conjure
images
to
be
feared.
The
easygoing
half-pint
race,
though
fierce,
is
often
regarded
with
some
degree
of
joviality.
Their
high-pitched
voices
and
naturally
cute
forms
inspire
something
of
a
protective
instinct
in
the
larger
races,
or
at
least
bring
to
mind
images
of
children
playing
at
being
adults.
Every
now
and
again,
however,
a
yordle
turns
so
bad
that,
even
at
its
small
stature,
it
strikes
terror
into
the
hearts
of
others.
Veigar
is
such
a
twisted
yordle.
As
a
master
of
the
magical
black
arts,
as
well
as
a
corrupter
of
cosmic
energy,
he
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
sorcerers
on
.

"Who
says
evil
needs
to
come
in
a
fearsome-looking
package?"
"Know
that
if
the
tables
were
turned,
I
would
show
you
no
mercy!"
"I
will
swallow
your
soul."
"Even
death
trembles
in
my
presence."
"Give
up
now!"
"Even
now,
your

"I

the

evil!
Stop

"I

"Yes!

"Stalking

"Suffering

"The

it

"Your

"It's
only

Is
that
a

"You

in

soul!
You
deny
