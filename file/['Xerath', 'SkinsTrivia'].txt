Xerath
was
designed
by
with
RiotRunaan
and
Ironstylus
providing
his
original
creative
concept
and
art,
respectively.
Xerath
is
voiced
by
.
Xerath
is
currently
the
only
entity
presented
as
(nearly)
omnipotent
in
the
universe,
and
currently
the
most
powerful.
Xerath
was
indirectly
referenced
in
the
prior
to
his
release.
When
Xerath
dies
his
body
quickly
becomes
unstable
and
overly
shiny,
just
to
blow
up
a
moment
later,
much
like
a
nuclear-powered
machine.
The
icon
for
Xerath's
ability,
is
slightly
similar
to
that

the
mastery
Xerath's
dance
is
known
as
"industrial
dancing",
which
is
evident
in
the
song

A
comparison

be
seen

Xerath
himself
can
be
seen
when
he
performs
his
taunt.
As
he
disarms
the
parts
of
his
sarcophagus,
a
person
made
of
pure
energy
or
electricity
can
be
briefly
seen.
There's
an
interesting
mechanic
that
can
be
seen
with
his
Classic,
Battlecast,
and
Runeborn
skins.
When
an
enemy
is
hit
with

they
leave
behind
a
purple
ball,
revealing
them.
The
Scorched
Earth
skin
does
not
seem
to
have
this.
Xerath
seems
to
be
cocky
about
his
position
as
an
ascendent
being,
reminding
the
summoners
that
he
is
ageless
and
all-mighty
and
seems
to
despise
normal
creatures,
considering
them
fragile
and
weak.
Some
speculate
that
Xerath
is
ambidextrous
as
he
uses
both
left
and
right
hands
for
different
attacks
and
abilities,
unlike
most
champions
who
almost
always
use
the
right
one.
From
the
lore,
many
people
believed
that
Xerath
was
going
to
be

disproved

Due

the
community's

both

skins
were
reworked.
