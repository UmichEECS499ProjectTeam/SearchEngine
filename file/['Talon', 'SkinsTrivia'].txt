Talon
was
designed
by
.
Talon's
champion
title
was
first
"The
Blade
Rogue",
and
later
"The
Shadow's
Blade".
When
he
was
released
his
champion
title
got
changed
again
to
"The
Blade's
Shadow".
It
is
unknown
exactly
why
his
title
was
changed
to
"The
Blade's
Shadow".
The
bird-like
creature
perched
on
the
fallen
sword
in
the
Sneak
Peek
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
Beatrice,
's
raven,
hinting
that
Talon's
past
may
be
interlaced
with
Swain's
in
some
way.
Similarly,
the
black
roses
surrounding
the
fallen
sword
in
the
Sneak
Peek
likely
represent
the
Black
Rose,
an
organization
of
which
is
the
leader.
Both
champions
are
elements
of
Noxus's
elite.
Talon

voiced
by

Talon's
dance
is
inspired
by
"Billie
Jean"
and
includes
moonwalk
and
crotch
grab.
His
passive
refers
to
"
",
the
act
of
killing
quickly
to
end
a
dying
person's
agony.
Talon's
design
elements,
background
and
appearance
are
all
reminiscent
of
the
main
characters
of
the
video
game
series
as
well
as
Thief
The
Dark
Project.
Talon
is
one
of
the
8

part
of
Noxus's
Crimson
Elite
theme,
meant
to
be
the
counterpart
to
the
Commando
skins.
So
far,
the
only
other
Crimson
Elite
member
is

though
she
may
have
left

a

to
be
referencing
from
the
Strider/Marvel

series.
Talon

the
"Crimson
Elite"

Talon
and
are
rivals.
As
revealed
in
Talon's
League
Judgement,
Talon
used
to
have
a
friend
and
partner
in
crime
back
when
he
was
a
young
thief
on
the
streets
of
Noxus.
His
name
was
Kavyn
and
the
two
lived
together
in
an
unused
pipe
in
the
sewers.
The
two
of
them
often
teamed
up
to
steal
food
and
other
things
from
merchants
on
the
streets,
however
Kavyn
was
very
unreliable
and
often
caused
Talon
to
nearly
get
caught.
One
day,
after
another
failure
due
to
Kavyn's
incompetence,
Kavyn
gave
Talon
some
daggers,
which
Talon
promptly
used
to
kill
Kavyn.
