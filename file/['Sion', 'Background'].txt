The
Demacians
thought
that
the
beheading
of
Sion
would
be
the
end
of
his
bloodthirsty
ways.
Death,
however,
was
merely
the
beginning
of
Sion's
rise
to
power.
The
famed
Noxian
assassin,

recovered
Sion's
remains
and
Noxian
necromancers
reanimated
the
behemoth
to
serve
Noxus
once
again.
Sion's
reanimation
actually
bestowed
new
powers
on
him
and
increased
the
potency
of
his
existing
abilities,
making
him
even
more
of
a
terror
to
behold
on
the
battlefield.
The
Noxian
High
Command
had
a
powerful
new
weapon
in
their
hands
-
one
they
have
brought
to
bear
as
a

Even
though
Sion's
increased
powers
would

him
a
powerful
tool

the
High
Command's
use

Noxus
no
longer
risks
losing
one
of
their
greatest
champions
in
the
League
to
chance
or
circumstance;
Sion's
days
as
a
front-line
fighter
for
Noxus'
military
conquests
are
at
an
end.

locked
in
a
brutal
series
of
on-again-off-again
wars
that
spanned

centuries.
Both

advantage

but
Noxus
was
the
city-state
willing

Only

to
Noxus,

this
is
