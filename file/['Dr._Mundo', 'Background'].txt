Dr.
Mundo
has
become
equal
parts
serial
killer
and
mad
scientist,
though
no
one
is
entirely
sure
how
his
butchery
qualifies
as
science.
However,
he
has
made
tremendous
strides
in
mapping
the
pain
response
in
the
human
brain
and
body,
going
so
far
as
being
able
to
suppress
it,
even
in
the
most
excruciating
of
circumstances.
He
has
also
tapped
into
the
primal
parts
of
the
brain
through
chemistry,
learning
how
to
enhance
aggression
and
adrenaline,
as
well
as
dulling
conscience
and
the
survival
instinct.
In
short,
Dr.
Mundo's
life's
work
has
been
how
to
create
the
perfect
science-enhanced
killer.
Unfortunately,
the
city-state
of
regards
such
behavior
as
a
sign
of
initiative
and
ambition,
rather
than
inhumanity.
Originally
fighting
for
Zaun,
Dr.
Mundo
was
recruited
to
also
fight
for
Noxus
in
;
the
Madman
dual
faction
status
represents
the
fruits
of
a
blossoming
relationship
between
Zaun
and
Noxus.
He
continues
his
experiments
to
this
day,
even
using
himself
as
an
experimental
subject,
as
evidenced
by
his
disfigured
appearance
and
his...
unique
manner
of
speaking.
There
are
rumors
that
the
High
Command
in
Noxus
has
given
him
free
reign
to
pursue
his
life's
work
in
his
spare
time.

It
is
said
that
the
man
now
known
as
Dr.
Mundo
was
born
in
the
city
of
without
any
sort
of
conscience.
Instead,
he
had
an
unquenchable
desire
to
inflict
pain
through
experimentation.
By
the
time
he
was
five,
most
of
the
pets
in
the
Zaun
neighborhood
where
Mundo
grew
up
had
gone
missing.
By
his
teenage
years,
his
parents
were
nowhere
to
be
found.
By
the
time
he
had
legally
acquired
his
license
to
practice
medicine,
he
had
been
acquitted
of
thirty-eight
separate
charges
of
murder
by
the
Zaun
authorities;
the
lack
of
evidence
made
prosecution
impossible.
