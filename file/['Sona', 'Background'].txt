When
a
wealthy
woman
named
Lestara
Buvelle
learned
of
the
instrument,
she
immediately
embarked
to
.
When
the
caretakers
showcased
the
instrument
for
her,
she
rose
wordlessly
and
explored
the
house,
stopping
outside
Sona’s
room.
Without
hesitation,
Lestara
adopted
her
and
left
a
generous
donation
for
the
instrument.
With
Lestara’s
guidance,
Sona
discovered
a
deep
connection
with
the
instrument
which
Lestara
called
an
"etwahl".
In
her
hands,
it
played
tones
which
stilled
or
quivered
the
hearts
of
those
around
her.
Within
months,
she
was
headlining
with
the
mysterious
etwahl
for
sold-out
audiences.
She
played
as
though
plucking
heartstrings,
effortlessly
manipulating
the
emotions
of
her
listeners
-
all
without
a
single
written
note.
In
secret,
she
discovered
a
potent
and
deadly
use
for
her
etwahl,
using
its
vibrations
to
slice
objects
from
a
distance.
She
honed
this
discipline
in
private,
mastering
her
gift.
When
she
felt
prepared,
she
went
to
the
only
place
which
could
offer
her
a
fitting
recital:
.
Because
Sona
cannot
speak,
these
responses
are
understood
to
be
magical
telepathy
with
her
summoner.
This
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
her
external
interactions
(taunt,
joke)
are
musical
cues
rather
than
words,
meaning
that,
as
stated,
only
her
summoner
can
hear
her
words.

by
:
Demacian
Ionia
the
League
of
Legends
Sona
has
no
memories
of
her
true
parents.
As
an
infant,
she
was
found
abandoned
on
the
doorstep
of
an
Ionian
adoption
house,
nestled
atop
an
ancient
instrument
in
an
exquisite
case
of
unknown
origins.
She
was
an
unusually
well-behaved
child,
always
quiet
and
content.
Her
caretakers
were
sure
she
would
find
a
home
quickly,
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
what
they
mistook
for
uncommon
geniality
was
actually
an
inability
to
speak
or
to
produce
any
sound
whatsoever.
Sona
remained
at
the
adoption
house
until
her
teens,
watching
in
hopeless
silence
as
prospective
adopters
passed
her
by.
During
this
time,
the
caretakers
sold
her
unusual
instrument
to
anxious
collectors,
hoping
to
build
her
a
trust.
For
a
myriad
of
bizarre
and
unexpected
reasons,
however,
it
would
be
returned,
or
simply
appear
again
outside
the
house.

"Her
melody
moves
the
soul,
her
silence
sunders
the
body."
―
,
after
attending
her
concert
"Only
you
can
hear
me,
Summoner.
What
masterpiece
shall
we
play
today?"
"Allegrissimo."
"Order
through
music."
"Brioso!
Brioso!"
"Shall
we
resolve
this
dissonance?"
"The
fanfare
ascends."
"A
symphony
of
justice."
"From
my
mind
to
yours."
"Adagio,
summoner."
"Harmoniously."
"Delicately."
"With
perfect
tempo."
"A
sublime
duet."
"Quarter
time!"
"Accurate,
like
a
metronome."
"Accelerated
movement,
I
concur."
