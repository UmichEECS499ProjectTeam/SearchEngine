she
has
100
Fury
and
remain
in
that
state
for
as
long
as
she
has
Fury.

Additional
Information:
Shyvana's
basic
attacks
generate
2
fury,
even
in
Dragon
Form
or
against
structures.
While
in
human
form,
Shyvana
passively
generates
fury
every
1.
seconds.
Shyvana
transforms
into
a
dragon
(more
exactly
a
Wyvern)
and
dashes
to
a
target
location.
Enemies
along
her
path
take
magic
damage
and
are
pushed
toward
her
target
location.
While
in
Dragon
Form,
Shyvana's
fury
decays
at
a
rate
of
5
per
second.
Once
her
fury
is
depleted,
she
will
return
to
her
normal
state.
Dragon's
Descent
has
no
cooldown
or
initial
cost
but
can
only
be
activated
when
Shyvana
has
100
fury.
