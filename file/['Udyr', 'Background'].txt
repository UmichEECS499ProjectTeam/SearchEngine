Udyr
is
a
martial
arts
champion
based
around
4
fighting
stances:
Tiger,
Turtle,
Bear,
and
Phoenix.
Each
form
has
an
activation
effect
and
a
persistent
effect.
The
persistent
effects
ensure
that
each
stance
fulfills
a
different
role,
while
the
activation
effects
encourage
Udyr
to
constantly
switch
as
the
battlefield
changes.
Udyr
is
a
champion
with
4
basic
abilities,
and
no
ultimate
(a
groundbreaking
skillset
in
the
League
of
Legends!),
allowing
players
to
choose
which
abilities
are
worth
maxing
out
based
on
how
the
game
has
evolved.
