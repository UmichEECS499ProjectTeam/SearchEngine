Dressed
to
the

with
a

overcoat
and
classy
boutonniere,
sleek
and
stylish
Debonair
Jayce
is
ready
for
Valentine’s
Day
for

RP
in
the
store.
Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman.
If
you've
been
waiting
for
the
League
to
acquire
a
Renaissance
man,
then
your
long
wait
is
over.
Meet
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow.
In
addition
to
being
a
class
act
and
charmer,
this
modern
gentleman
is
one
of
Piltover's
premier
scientific
geniuses.
This
brazen,
well-equipped
man
for
all
seasons
sports
hi-tech
armor
and
wields
the
skull-crushing
Mercury
Hammer
that
also
transforms
into
the
Mercury
Cannon.
Whether
you
want
to
get
up
close
and
personal
to
punish
enemies
with
a
gigantic
blunt
instrument
or
shake
things
up
by
peppering
opponents
with
energy
blasts
from
a
distance,
Jayce
has
the
skills
it
takes
to
deliver.
Announcement
made
by
.
If
you're
ready
to
add
a
little
versatility
to
your
fighter
or
ranged
carry
game,
look
no
further
than
Jayce,
the
Defender
of
Tomorrow.
Jayce's
transforming
weapon
allows
him
to
adapt
to
nearly
any
situation,
making
him
an
extremely
versatile
champion
for
whatever
role
you
need
filled
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
The
lynchpin
in
Jayce's
kit
is
his
ultimate.
Starting
with
a
free
rank
at
level
1,
Jayce
can
activate
his
ultimate
to
transform
his
weapon
into
either
the
short
range
Mercury
Hammer
or
the
long
range
Mercury
Cannon.
Each
time
he
transitions
he'll
receive
a
bonus
effect
on
his
next
basic
attack
that
either
shreds
the
target's
defensive
stats
(ranged
mode)
or
deals
significantly
increased
damage
(melee
mode).
Selecting
the
right
weapon
type
for
your
current
engagement
is
the
key
to
playing
Jayce
effectively.
While
ranged,
Jayce
can
pepper
enemies
with
ranged
attacks,
deploying
Shock
Blast
and
Hypercharge
to
wear
down
opponents
while
utilizing
Acceleration
Gate
to
Keep
his
team
at
a
safe
distance.
Having
worn
an
enemy
down
in
this
manner,
Acceleration
Gate
can
be
repurposed
to
give
chase,
allowing
him
to
shift
his
weapon
into
its
hammer
form
and
leap
into
the
fray
with
To
the
Skies!
Once
he's
closed
the
distance,
he
can
utilize
Thundering
Blow
to
pick
up
a
quick
kill,
while
the
additional
armor
from
being
in
melee
mode
gives
him
the
toughness
necessary
to
either
withdraw
or
continue
fighting
at
close
range.
However
you
choose
to
play
Jayce,
canny
shifting
between
his
weapon
modes
will
make
or
break
your
success
on
the
battlefield.

Hammer
into
the

gaining

abilities
and

range.
The

the
target's
armor
and
magic
resist.
Abilities
(Mercury
Cannon):
Jayce
fires
an
orb
of
electricity
that
detonates
upon
hitting
an

(or

its
path)
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
in
the
area
of
the
explosion.
Jayce

a
burst
of
energy,
increasing

speed

maximum
for
several
attacks.
Jayce
deploys
an
Acceleration
Gate
increasing
the
movement
speed
of
all
allies
who
pass
through
it.
If
Shock
Blast
is
fired
through
the
gate
the
missile
speed,
range,
and
damage
will
increase.
Transforms
the
Mercury
Cannon
into
the
Mercury
Hammer
gaining
new
abilities
and
increasing
armor
and
magic
resist.

this
form
deals
additional
magic
damage.
