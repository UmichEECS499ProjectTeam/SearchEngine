â€•The
Journal
of
"Science
is
on
the
march.
Look
out!"
"Indeed,
a
wise
choice."
"Eureka!"
"Eureka!!"
"For
great
science!"
"I
theorize...
your
defeat!"
"Back,
you
dirty
ape!
Back!"
"You
are
poorly
designed
for
this!"
"The
cosine
of
U
root,
divided
by..."
"Hmm...
very
interesting."
"I
could
help
you
do
that
better."
"Order,
entropy;
a
never-ending
cycle."
"I
concur!"
"Yes,
yes,
hurry,
I
have
important
work
to
get
back
to."
"And
what
did
you
expect
from
such
a
substandard
intelligence?!"
"Why
do
chemists
call
helium,
curium,
and
barium
'the
medical
elements'?
Because,
if
you
can't
'helium'
or
'curium',
you
'BARIUM'!"

"I

your
defeat!"
"Back,
you
dirty
ape,
back!"
"You
are
poorly
designed
for
this!"
"What
a
reaction!"
"Working
as
intended!"
"Exceeding
turret
output
capacity!"
"Stop
that!
You
will
damage
my
turrets!"
"Raise
your
what?"
"This
behaviour
is
highly
inefficient!"
"Testing
in
progress!"
"This
calls
for
a
prototype!"
"I've
applied
the
formula
for
success!"
"Mind
your
vectors!"
"I
require
my
adjustable
reverse-ratcheting
magnetic
box
wrench!"
"Stand
back!
I
am
about
to
do...
science!"
"They'll
have
a
few
screws
loose
by
the
end
of
this!"
"This
will
put
a
wrench
in
their
plans!"
"The
cosine
of
U-root,
divided

"Hmm...
very
interesting!"
"I

"Yes,
yes,
hurry,
I

important
work
to
get
back
to!"
"Hmm...
let
me
fix
that."
"Wonderfully
efficient!"
"Goggles
on!"
"By
calculations..."
"Did
I
leave
the
Tridyminiumobulator
on?"
"Just
as
I
hypothesized!"
"Aha!"
"How
befuddling!"
"I
put
the
scheme
in
schematic!"
"What
an
uncommon
denominator!"
"Back
to
the
drawing
board!"
"Aha,
42,
I
knew
it!
Now
-
er,
what
was
the
question
again?"
"42...
there's
just
something
about
that
number."
"I
do
love
a
good
conundrum."
"Every
problem
solved
is
another
revealed."
"One
step
closer
to
greater
understanding!"
"Fascinating,
isn't
it?"
"Not
enough
variables...
hmm...
not
nearly
enough
variables."
"Order,
entropy;
a
never
ending
cycle.
Or
is
it?"
"Brain
over
brawn!"
"Why
do
chemists
call
helium,
curium,
and
barium
'the
medical
elements'?
Because,
if
you
can't
'helium'
or
'curium',
you
'barium'!
Hm
hm!"
"Why
do
people
say
'you
can't
trust
atoms'?
Because
they
'make
up
everything'!
Hehe!"
"There
are
three
key
ingredients
to
invention:
excessive
imagination,
good
old
fashioned
stick-to-it-iveness,
and
a
rocking
good
hairstyle!"
"I
prefer
a
battle
of
wits,
but
you're
unarmed!"
"Don't
worry,
you
can
learn
so
much
from
failure."
"I
don't
agree
with
your
methods,
but
by
golly,
do
you
get
results!"
"Have
you
considered
making
quieter
hexplosives?"
"Your
hexplosives
are
disturbing
my
research."
"Would
you
mind
taking
your
hexplosives
elsewhere?"
"If
you
seek
to
replace
all
humans,
there
will
be
no
one
left
to
appreciate
your
work."
"Ah,
Jayce.
Mind
if
I
borrow
some
of
your
'hexpertise'?"
"Groundbreaking
hextech
innovation
employed
in
the
service...
of
punching."
Heimerdinger
laughs.

"Hmm,
it's
smaller
than
the
diagram."
"It's
gone
mad!"
"Rise,
my
creation!"
"Ah,
the
sweet
smell
of
science!"
"No,
not
the
rockets!"
"Perhaps
I
should
try
rockets!"
"Come
on...
nngh...?!
WAAAAA-"
