and
monsters
take
full
damage
from

of
the
target
enemy,
dealing
physical
damage
to
all
enemies
in
a
1100-unit
line.
Minions
take
75%
damage.
Additional
Information:
Lucian
fires
a
shot
that
explodes
in
a
cross
pattern
upon
hitting
an
enemy
or
reaching
the
end
of
its
path,
dealing
magic
damage
and
marking
enemies
hit
for
6
seconds.
If
Lucian
damages
a
marked
target
with
his
basic
attacks
or
abilities,
he
gains
40
movement
speed
for
2
seconds.
This
does
not
consume
the
mark.

dashes
a
short
distance
and
removes
all
slowing
effects.

kill
during
The
Culling.
Additional
Information:
Lucian
starts
firing
shots
in
the
target
direction
for
3
seconds,
each
shot
dealing
physical
damage
to
the
first
enemy
it
hits.
The
number
of
shots
fired
scales
with
his
attack
speed.
The
Culling
deals
quadruple
damage
to
minions
but
monsters.
While
using
The
Culling,
Lucian's
basic
attacks
are
disabled
and

cannot
activate
Piercing
Light
or
Ardent
Blaze.
He
can,
however,
move
freely
and
activate

Culling
can
be
reactivated
to
end
the
effect
early
and
it
is
interrupted
by
crowd
control
effects
that
inhibit
basic
attacks.
