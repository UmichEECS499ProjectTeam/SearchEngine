The
trail
of
bodies
led
him
to
a
crumbling
stone
temple.
Inside
he
found
an
aging
monk
who
appraised
him
with
eyes
of
pure
crimson.
Vladimir
surprised
the
monk
by
returning
the
wicked
gaze
with
zeal.
Recognizing
the
boy’s
sinister
craving,
the
monk
taught
Vladimir
how
to
manipulate
and
control
the
fluid
of
life,
often
practicing
on
passing
travelers.
When
it
came
time
for
Vladimir
to
learn
the
final
lesson,
the
monk
warned
that
failure
would
result
in
death.
Vladimir
did
not
fail,
but
success
bore
a
grisly
surprise.
During
the
ritual,
every
drop
of
the
monk's
blood
was
drawn
from
his
body
and
fused
with
Vladimir's,
imbuing
him
with
his
master's
magical
essence,
and
that
of
every
hemomancer
before
him.
Left
alone
and
suddenly
without
purpose,
Vladimir
resolved
to
return
to
Noxus,
demanding
enrollment
in
to
prove
the
supremacy
of
his
craft.
When
the
High
Command
observed
the
gruesome
fates
which
befell
the
palace
guards,
they
elected
to
avail
themselves
of
Vladimir's
unsavory
talents.
An
ominous
force
has
appeared
on
the
Fields
of
Justice.
A
spectator
caught
this
glimpse
in
a
recent
battle,
but
officials
are
unsure
of
what
to
make
of
it.
What’s
clear,
though,
is
that
whatever
it
is
should
not
to
be
taken
lightly.
Take
a
look
for
yourself,
summoner…
Summoners!
The
Blood
Lord
is
coming
to
the
League
of
Legends!
In
addition
to
a
new
and
intimidating
model,
this
legendary
take
on
Vladimir,
the
Crimson
Reaper,
will
feature
vicious
new
voice
over,
spell
effects,
and
animations.
If
you’d
like
to
indulge
your
dark
side
by
living
out
fantasies
of
holding
the
lives
of
your
enemies
in
the
palm
of
your
hand,
Blood
Lord
Vladimir
should
help
slake
that
thirst!
Nothing
is
sweeter
than
the
blood
of
your
enemies!

There
is
a
temple
hidden
in
the
mountains
between
and
the
Tempest
Flats,
where
the
secrets
of
an
ancient
and
terrifying
sorcery
are
kept.
The
area
surrounding
the
temple
is
littered
with
the
exsanguinated
corpses
of
those
who
have
mistakenly
wandered
too
close.
These
served
only
to
pique
the
curiosity
of
Vladimir,
when
–
in
his
youth
–
he
trekked
through
these
mountains
during
his
flight
from
Noxus.
A
day
earlier,
the
teenaged
Vladimir
had
brutally
murdered
two
boys
of
his
age,
for
no
better
reason
than
to
enjoy
the
intoxicating
scarlet
bloom
that
surged
forth.
He
realized
immediately
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
suppress
his
murderous
desires,
and
if
he
remained
in
Noxus,
his
foul
deeds
were
sure
to
catch
up
with
him.
Without
hesitation,
he
abandoned
the
city-state,
and
journeyed
south.

If
you’re
like
me
and
you’ve
ever
gone
through
one
of
those
dark,
goth
phases
at
some
point
in
your
life,
you’ll
probably
relate
to
this
next
champion
at
least
a
little
bit.
Meet
Vladimir,
the
Crimson
Reaper.
This
champion
combines
the
epic
power
of
fueling
his
magic
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
with
the
style
and
flair
of
Transylvanian
count.
You
know
the
type
of
count
we’re
talking
about…
the
type
that
has
a
lifetime
supply
of
liquid
black
eyeliner
sitting
in
his
medicine
cabinet.
So
dust
off
that
copy
of
Bram
Stoker’s
Dracula
that
you’ve
got
sitting
on
your
nightstand.
If
you
start
reading
now,
you
should
be
super
excited
by
the
prospect
of
getting
your
hands
on
Vladimir
by
the
time
you
finish.
