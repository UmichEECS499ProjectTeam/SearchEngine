Ten
years
ago,
Kayle's
war
against
evil
was
nearly
won...
until
her
rebellious
sister
,
a
pariah
amongst
their
people,
suddenly
gained
powerful
new
allies:
magicians
of
a
hitherto
unknown
world
called
.
Morgana
traded
servitude
to
a
number
of
the
in
Runeterra's
for
powerful
new
abilities
that,
if
mastered,
threatened
to
bring
Kayle
and
her
people
to
their
knees.
To
save
her
world,
Kayle
had
no
choice
but
to
make
a
pact
with
the
League
herself.
She
approached
the
leader
of
the
League,
High
Counselor
Reginald
Ashram,
with
a
deal
of
her
own.
In
exchange
for
a
thousand
years
of
Kayle's
service,
Ashram
halted
all
League
interference
on
Kayle's
world.
With
Ashram's
disappearance
five
years
ago,
Kayle
has
new
causes
on
:
find
out
who
or
what
caused
Ashram
to
disappear,
defeat
her
sister
Morgana
upon
the
,
and
bring
her
own
brand
of
justice
to
the
League
of
Legends.

In
a
world
far
away
where
an
ancient
war
still
rages,
Kayle
was
a
great
heroine
-
the
strongest
of
an
immortal
race
committed
to
destroying
evil
wherever
it
could
be
found.
For
ten
thousand
years,
Kayle
fought
tirelessly
for
her
people,
wielding
her
flaming
sword
forged
before
time
itself.
She
shielded
her
delicate
features
beneath
her
enchanted
armor,
the
sole
remaining
masterpiece
of
an
extinct
race
of
craftsmen.
Though
a
beautiful,
striking
creature,
Kayle,
now
as
then,
avoids
showing
her
face;
war
has
taken
a
terrible
toll
upon
her
spirit.
In
her
quest
for
victory,
she
sometimes
would
try
to
lift
the
wicked
up
from
their
morass
of
evil,
but
more
than
often
she
instead
purged
those
she
herself
deemed
beyond
redemption.
To
Kayle,
justice
can
so
often
be
an
ugly
thing.
"In
the
League
of
Legends,
Justice
comes
on
swift
wings."
"Into
the
fray!"
"Lead
me
to
battle."
"Into
the
fray!"
"Who's
next?"
"Your
time
has
come."
"An
eye
for
an
eye."
"Come
here!
I'll
teach
you
all
about
the
afterlife."
"Are...
You
sure
you're
not
in
the
wrong
league?"
Kayle
laughs.

"Ugh,
dust
in
the
clockwork."
"Let
my
blade
speak
the
law!"
"Transcend
imperfection."
"To
rebuild
we
must
first
destroy."
"Faith
and
steel
unbroken."
"There
will
be
no
compromise."
"This
is
for
the
greater
good."
"By
wing
and
blade."
"Order,
through
time
and
space."
"A
future
forged
in
light
and
steel."
"Everything
in
its
place."
"I
bring
a
vision
of
utopia."
"Perfection
unto
eternity."
"Trust
in
my
vision."
"Prosperity
through
technology."
"The
whole
world
in
our
image."
"Nothing
left
in
flux."
"Crafted
in
divine
light."
"I
see
into
infinity."
"In
time,
all
will
understand."
"What?
No!
Ugh...
Hmm.
Sometimes
you
just
need
to
reboot
the
system."
"Uh,
malfunction?
What
I...
Uh,
I
mean...
That
was
all
part
of
the
grand
plan!"
"Uh,
oh,
ah,
wha-
wait.
See?
Perfection."
"So
long
as
I
have
my
wings,
you
will
always
stand
in
my
shadow."
"The
future
is
perfection.
It's
a
pity
you
will
not
live
to
see
it."
