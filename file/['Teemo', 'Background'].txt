Look!
Up
in
the
sky!
It’s
a
cryophoenix!
It’s
a
gyrocopter!
It’s
Super
Teemo!
If
you’ve
ever
dreamed
of
being
faster
than
a
speeding
Rammus,
more
powerful
than
a
mighty
Cho’gath,
and
able
to
leap
tall
yordles
in
a
single
bound,
then
you’ll
definitely
want
to
pick
up
Super
Teemo.
With
powers
and
abilities
far
beyond
those
of
mere
mortal
yordles,
you’ll
be
ready
to
fight
the
never-ending
battle
for
truth,
justice,
and
the
Bandle
City
way!
Super
Teemo
will
be
swooping
in
to
save
a
metropolitan
area
near
you
on
Monday
the
10th
of
October,
so
be
sure
to
stop
by
to
greet
him
at
the
League
of
Legends
Store!
Summoners!
"Teemo
rides
a
thin
line
between
chipper
compatriot
and
unrepentant
killer,
but
there's
no
one
else
I'd
rather
have
as
a
friend."
―
"Though
he
is
known
as
the
Swift
Scout,
it
is
clear
that
Teemo
is
actually
something
else
-
the
unrepentant
assassin
of
Bandle
City."
"Captain
Teemo
on
duty."
"Hut

four."
"Yes
sir!"
"I'll
scout
ahead!"
"Armed
and
ready."
"That's
gotta
sting."
"Reporting
in."
"Swiftly!"
"Never
underestimate
the
power
of
the
Scout's
code."
"Size
doesn't
mean
everything."
Teemo
laughs.
