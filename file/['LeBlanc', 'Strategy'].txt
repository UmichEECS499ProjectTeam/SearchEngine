clone
acts
like
a
pet.
It
will
take
commands
similarly
to
.
It
is
wise
to
manually
control
it
for
the
means
of
confusing
the
opponent,
as
a
clone
heading
in
a
nonsensical
direction
after
being
summoned
clearly
betrays
the
real
to
the
enemy.
provides
LeBlanc
with
a
deceptively
large
radius
of
threat.
If
you
are
being
chased,
throw
on
the
pursuer
for
the
slow
and
potential
snare.
The
second
damaging
part
of
can
also
trigger
the
silence
from
.
When
you
end
up
in
a
team
fight,
you
should
consider
utility
of
your
spells
over
damage,
and
consider
using
as
your
spell
for
a
double
slow
and
longer
snare.
A
quick
way
to
cast
any
of
LeBlanc's
spells
is
to
smart-cast
them,
either
by
remapping
smart-cast
spells
to
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R
or
holding
shift
and
then
hitting
Q
/
W
/
E
/
R.
When
combined
with
the
combo
above
you
could
potentially
drop
an
enemy
carry
in
one
burst
before
they
have
time
to
react.
Activating
silence
mark
with
synergizes
perfectly
with
its
delayed
snare,
preventing
the
target
from
using
or
other
escape
mechanisms
for
more
than
3
seconds.
This
should
allow
yourself
or
your
team
to
secure
kills.
Chaining
with
can
provide
good
harassment
and
long
silence
periods
early-mid
game
and
can
shut
down
troublesome
casters
later
on.
By
selecting
a
target
to
cast
on
while
out
of
range,
you
can
use
to
close
the
gap,
and
then
use
it
again
to
return
to
safety.
Doing
this
can
extend
the
range
at
which
you
can
safely
harass
and
ward
enemy
champions
from
gold
or
experience.
While
it
may
seem
unintuitive,
is
actually
one
of
the
best
core
items
for
LeBlanc.
It
affords
her
some
cheap
magic
resist
to
increase
her
durability
in
lane,
virtually
eliminates
her
mana
problems,
and
most
importantly
it
provides
her
a
large
bonus
to
cooldown
reduction,
which,
because
of
her
high
base
damage,
drastically
increases
her
overall
damage.
can
be
especially
powerful,
particularly
if
mid-laning.
Be
warned
that
due
to
her
already
snowbally
nature,
getting
killed
while
using
this
item
may
cause
her
to
fall
even
earlier
in
the
game
than
necessary.
can
be
very
powerful
for
as
it
covers
AP
and
an
additional
spell
in
her
combo
with
its
Active,
which
will
make
her
more
of
a
threat
in
the
later
stages
of
a
game.
can
be
a
good
early
game
choice
for
,
as
it
increases
durability
and
damage,
while
also
negating
early
game
Magic
Resistance.
It
can
also
replace
in
many
builds,
allowing
the
use
of
other
boots
without
sacrificing
Magic
Penetration.
Two
s
during
early
game
provides
cheap
and
highly
effective
stats.
Investing
in
an
early
for
will
significantly
reduce
her
burst
damage.
Later
in
the
game,
you
can
build
it
into
a
and
disrupt
her
combo.
Otherwise,
if
you
are
playing
a
squishy
mage
or
AD
carry,
she
will
be
able
to
burst
you
down
even
late
game
due
to
good
scaling.
Do
NOT
neglect
MR.
LeBlanc
relies
heavily
on
spell
combos,
especially
with
her
and
its
mimic.
Try
to
interrupt
her
spell
combo
in
the
middle
of
,
as
this
will
often
force
her
back
to
wait
for
cooldown.
Be
sure
not
to
use
a
champion
who
relies
on
skillshots
or
delayed
AoE
damage
to
fight
her,
her
quadruple
moves
(with
both
s)
can
make
her
untouchable
by
champions
such
as
Lux,
Xerath,
Diana,
Ziggs
or
Zyra.
Try
to
scare
LeBlanc
a
bit
to
force
her
to
use
her
dashes
prior
to
a
gank
,
as
the
long
cooldown
will
make
her
an
easy
target.
's
clone
does
carry
buffs-
use
this
to
identify
the
real
LeBlanc.
Always
wait
for
her
passive
to
trigger
before
targeting
her
with
an
ultimate
like
because
otherwise
she
will
most
likely
get
away
with
.
LeBlanc
is
extremely
squishy
so
she
is
very
vulnerable
to
hard
cc
and
focus.
Taking
her
out
of
the
fight
early
prevents
her
from
being
able
to
burst
down
a
carry.
's
stealth
does
not
break
the
auto
attacking
AI's
lock
on
her;
allowing
the
autoattacking
AI
to
continue
without
interruption
can
finish
her
off.
LeBlanc
is
notorious
for
being
able
to
burst
down
AP
mid
laners.
However,
because
she
specializes
on
bursting
one
target,
having
your
jungler
gank
during
her
dives
will
cripple
her
aggression
significantly
and
cause
her
to
fall
off
prematurely.
Warding
brushes
will
make
it
harder
for
LeBlanc
to
juke
using
.
LeBlanc
has
poor
farming
capabilities;
if
you're
unable
to
make
trades
safely,
then
simply
clear
minion
waves
quickly
to
force
her
back.
