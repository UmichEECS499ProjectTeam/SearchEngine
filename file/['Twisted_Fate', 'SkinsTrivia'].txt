Fate
is
frequently
compared
to

weapon
of

The
Terot
Twisted
Fate's
dance
is

A

mode
,or
by
looking
at

Noon
Twisted

art

PAX

Twisted
Fate
and
The
Magnificent

Fate
shows

using
.
Although
The
Magnificent

In
the
Chinese
artwork,
the
same
art
is
used
for
both
skins,
with
the
only
difference
being
the
position

the
spotlight.
The
cards
that
appear
when
Underworld
Twisted
Fate
uses
his
ult
have
the
same
symbol
on
them
that

of
Hearts
Twisted
Fate
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
Red
Mage
class
from
the
Final
Fantasy
series.

outfit
worn
by
Jericho
Cross
in
the
video
game
DarkWatch
(see
).
It
could
also
be
based
of
Gambit
of
the
X-men's
Horseman
of
Death
outfit
(see
)
Twisted
Fate
and
were
the
first
reported
couple
in
.
However,
Evelynn
has
reportedly
ended
the
relationship
in
.
Twisted
Fate
and
were
partners
in
the
past.
That
is
until
Twisted
Fate
sold
out
Graves
to
Dr.
Priggs
in
exchange
for
a
risky
experiment
that
gave
Twisted
Fate
his
magical
abilities.
There
is
speculation
that
Twisted
Fate
is
the
cat
burglar
in
which
is
attempting
to
track
