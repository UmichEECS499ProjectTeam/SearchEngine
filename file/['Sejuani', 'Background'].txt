Announcement
made
by
NeeksNaman
"I
was
cut
from
the
ice,
shaped
in
the
storms,
hardened
in
the
cold."
―
"Freljord
provides
for
the
few.
For
the
others,
'peace'
means
only
death."
―
"They
plead
for
mercy
when
they
hear
our
drums,
but
the
wolf
owes
no
consideration
to
the
prey.
We
do
not
sow
seeds
and
till
earth
like
the
Avarosan.
We
do
not
stand
watch
over
shattered
ruins
like
the
Frostguard.
We
do
not
pity
the
meek,
for
courage
is
the
true
salvation
of
the
Freljord!
We
are
the
war
cry
of
the
wind,
we
are
the
strength
of
the
mountains.
We
are
the
claws
of
winter!"
―
"Trust
nothing
but
your
strength."
"They
will
feed
my
boar."
"Die
with
weapon
in
hand."
"Prove
your
worth."
"Trample
them!"
"I
was
born
for
conquest."
"Stand
and
fight!"
"I
won't
be
denied!"
"I
was
forged
by
winter."
"Show
them
our
teeth."
"Run
them
down!"
"Bristle,
attack!"
"Leave
no
survivors."
"Seize
what's
ours."
"You
own
what
you
take."
"Fight
or
make
room
for
those
who
will."
"Deeds,
not
words."
"We
fight
while
cowards
talk."
"No
spoils
for
the
meek."
"Living
in
fear
is
not
living
at
all."
"I
will
not
tolerate
weakness."
"I
will
not
hide
behind
another
shield."
"Bristle
seems
hungry
today..."
"We
bow
to
no
one!"
"The
cold
does
not
forgive."
"There
is
no
strength
in
servitude."
"I
will
rule
the
Freljord."
"Pain
is
nothing."
"Ride
onward!"
"Flee
like
the
cowards
you
are!"
"Don't
worry,
Bristle,
I'll
leave
you
the
scraps."
"Those
who
oppose
me
get
gored."
"Easy,
Bristle.
The
archer's
mine."
"Which
will
snap
more
easily?
The
bow,
or
you?"
"Ice
Witch,
prepare
to
be
shattered!"
[laughs]
"Are
icicles
the
best
you
can
muster?"
"Who
wants
a
treat?
Bristle
wants
a
treat?
Not
until
we've
trampled
our
foes
to
dust!"
"Can
you
smell
coward,
Bristle?
Get
'em!"
Sejuani
laughs.
Sejuani
laughs.
Sejuani
laughs.
Sejuani

"Stampede!"
"Charge!"
"Die!"
"There's
no
use
running!"
"A
gift
from
the
Freljord!"
"We
settle
this,
here,
and
now!"
"I
rule
the
Freljord!"
"For
my
ancestors!"
"Trample
them."
"Bristle,
attack!"
"Run
them
down!"
"Strike
at
their
heart."
"Leave
no
survivors."
"This
is
our
fight!"
"Prove
your
worth,
summoner!"
"To
the
bitter
end."
"We
will
endure!"
"Ride
onward."
"Do
not
relent."
"Victory
at
any
cost."
"I
belong
in
battle."
"I
will
rule
Freljord."
"You'll
make
excellent
boar
food."
"Those
who
oppose
me
get
gored!"
"Hey,
get
up!
How
many
times
have
I
told
you:
'No
sleeping
during
battle!'"
"Hey,
wake
up!
No
dinner
for
you,
tonight."
Sejuani
laughs.

"Stampede!"
"Trample!"
Sejuani
was
designed
by
As
some
of
our
more
discerning
lore-hounds
may
have
anticipated,
Sejauni,
the
Winter's
Wrath,
is
charging
in
as
our
next
upcoming
champion.
We
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
talk
to
you
about
her
gameplay,
and
what
you
can
expect
to
see.
Hailing
from
the
Freljord,
Sejuani
combines
raw,
physical
might
with
the
chilling
ice
of
her
homeland.
After
slowing
enemies
with
her
Frost
passive
on
auto-attacks,
she
can
activate
her
Permafrost
ability
to
drastically
increase
the
slow
and
inflict
damage.
This
allows
her
to
continuously
disrupt
enemy
movements
and
create
a
threatening
presence
–
a
necessity
of
any
primary
tank.
Sejuani's
initiation
ability
comes
from
two
sources:
the
powerful
skillshot
charge
from
her
boar
and
her
Glacial
Prison
ultimate.
The
former
tramples
enemies
and
applies
Frost,
while
the
latter
flings
a
giant
ice
shard
from
her
flail,
stunning
anything
it
hits
by
encasing
it
in
ice.
Enemies
near
that
target
get
stunned
for
a
shorter
durartion.
This
makes
accurate
skillshots
important,
as
Sejuani
needs
move
into
the
right
position
to
maximize
the
stun
duration
on
her
intended
target.
If
used
correctly,
this
ability
can
change
the
outcome
of
a
teamfight.
If
used
on
a
sub-optimal
target,
however,
it
will
be
partially
wasted
on
a
tank
or
lower-value
target.
This
being
our
first
mounted
champion,
we're
happy
to
release
not
only
an
epic
barbarian
woman
on
a
giant
boar,
but
also
a
tank
who
can
use
continuous
soft
disruption
with
bursts
of
big,
ultimate
initiation!
