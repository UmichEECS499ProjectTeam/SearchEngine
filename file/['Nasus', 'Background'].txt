.
As
the
scholar-warrior
raises
his
halberd,
the
sun
glints
off
the
blade
just
before
the
Siphoning
Strike
comes
crashing
down.
Nasus
stands
guardian
anew,
the
sand
shaken
from
his
armor,
his
visual
update
complete.
Each
of
his
abilities
is
accompanied
by
new
animations
and
particles,
completely
updating
the
vision
of
Nasus.
Fury
of
the
Sands
is
accompanied
by
a
ferocious
roar,
intimidating
particles
and
a
darkened
emblem
of
his
homeland.
All
of
the
Curator's
skins
have
been
studiously
renewed
as
well.
His
spirit
aflame
and
renewed,
Nasus
casts
a
withering
pall
over
his
enemies,
ensuring
that
the
cycle
of
life
and
death
continues.
Here
falls
the
shadow
of
despair.A
dark
symbol
sears
the
ground
beneath
his
victim,
burning
everything
within.
Infernal
Nasus
is
on
the
hunt.
Dark,
shadowy
hands
encircle
his
quarry,
choking
their
movement
as
if
immersed
in
sludge.
There
is
no
escape.
"Here
falls
the
shadow
of
despair."
He
stands
above
his
prey,
a
legend
come
alive
and
growls,
"I
am
death."
Infernal
Nasus’s
pauldrons
break
free
with
exultant
howls
as
flames
ignite
the
fury
of
the
sands.
Death
would
be
preferable
to
what
comes
next.
"This
is
the
way
your
world
ends."
With
fiery
new
particles,
shadow
effects
and
animations
including
a
unique
second
form
during
his
ultimate,
Infernal
Nasus
is
the
new,
darker
legendary
skin
for
the
Curator
of
the
Sands.
From
a
dark,
twisted
vision
of
the
world,
Infernal
Nasus
howls
with
feral
power.
Siphoning
Strike
echoes
with
a
malevolent
glow
upon
his
halberd,
while
Wither
summons
shadows
to
clutch
and
grasp
his
quarry.
When
he
calls
forth
Spirit
Fire
the
ground
blazes
with
black
flame.
With
his
prey
already
cowering,
his
rage
ignites
the
Fury
of
the
Sands.
Infernal
Nasus
towers
over
his
foe,
three
maws
spouting
fire.
His
passing
leaves
nothing
but
dust.
