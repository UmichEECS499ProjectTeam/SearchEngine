Placing
on
allied
initiators
such
as
,
,
and
as
they
are
about
to
initiate
on
multiple
enemies
is
a
good
way
to
help
rack
up
burst
damage.
Using
on
,
,
,
,
,
,
or
can
lead
to
a
heavy
unexpected
nuke
to
the
enemy
team,
thanks
to
these
characters'
ability
to
stealth.
Placing
a
on
an
enemy
pet
will
cause
it
to
follow
him
if
he
walks
away
from
his
pet.
This
is
great
placement
for
a
no-escape
harass
or
instant
kill
at
low
health.
Also
consider
Annie's
pet
bear
Tibbers.
After
triggering
an
enemy
passive,
,
place
one
bomb
on
one
bloblet
and
another
bomb
on
a
different
bloblet.
As
the
timer
ticks
down,
the
bombs
will
get
crawl
closer
together
and
more
likely
finish
him
off.
However
if
you
quickly
double
bomb
one
bloblet
before
the
rest
get
close,
only
one
bloblet
will
be
killed,
and
Zac
will
revive.
Placing
a
on
an
ally
as
they
teleport
(
,
,
etc.)
may
help
you
get
an
assist.
You
can
combine
the
use
of
and
to
place
two
on
a
target
quickly.
As
this
causes
the
first
bomb
to
instantly
explode,
this
is
main
damage
combo.
If
the
first
bomb
is
enough
to
kill
the
target,
both
bombs
will
explode.
This
can
be
very
effective
for
farming
and
pushing.
This
combo
costs
a
lot
of
,
so
you
may
not
want
to
use
it
for
harassing.
This
strategy
can
be
a
good
way
to
damage
enemy
champions
standing
near
the
target
before
they
have
a
chance
to
shield
themselves
from
damage.
Using
bombs
on
your
own
or
enemy
minions,
is
a
good
way
of
zoning
your
opponent.
If
the
enemy
champion
is
melee,
they
have
to
either
wait
4
seconds
for
the
bomb
to
explode,
or
be
damaged
by
the
bomb
if
they
choose
to
farm
that
minion.
Consider
enemy
champions
shield
durations
or
damage
reductions
when
casting
time
bomb.
For
example,
after
casts
shunpo,
she
takes
15%
reduced
damage
for
1.5
seconds.
Therefore
placing
a
single
bomb
on
her
after
shunpo
will
detonate
4
seconds
later,
with
no
damage
reduction
from
shunpo.
Or,
placing
a
single
bomb
immediately,
then
waiting
for
the
shunpo
damage
reduction
to
wear
off
before
the
casting
the
second
bomb
will
also
avoid
damage
reduction
from
shunpo.
Another
example
is
's
,
which
shields
LeeSin
and
an
ally
champion
for
5
seconds.
If
casts
on
directly,
he
can
safeguard
any
time
before
the
bomb
goes
off
to
mitigate
the
damage.
However,
if
casts
safeguard
while
farming
for
example,
mentally
count
to
1
before
placing
a
on
.
The
safeguard
shield
will
expire
before
the
four
second
countdown
of
,
thus
taking
full
damage.
This
is
a
more
mana
efficient
method
of
harass,
compared
to
double
bombing
him
while
his
shield
is
still
active.
Also,
now
that
is
on
cooldown
for
9
seconds,
there
is
a
time
window
where
Zilean
may
be
able
bomb
him
before
he
is
able
to
shield
the
second
bomb
as
well.
With
minor
cooldown
reduction
and
,
you
can
keep
higher
ranks
of
on
yourself
permanently
barring
mana
costs.
Use
this
to
quickly
get
to
teamfights
to
help,
or
lanes
to
defend/push.
Using
and
can
become
a
reliable
farming
strategy
with
higher
ranks
invested
in
them.
Place
one
on
a
caster
minion,
then
quickly
place
another.
The
bomb
should
have
done
enough
damage
to
leave
the
caster
minion
at
low
health.
Land
an
auto
attack
on
it
to
set
the
bomb
off
sooner.
Against
melee
champs,
you
can
place
a
time
bomb
on
your
own
minion
that
is
low
on
life
just
before
they
hit
it
to
CS.
This
is
a
very
safe
way
to
harass
them
if
they
have
a
similar
range
such
as
's
Q
(650)
or
's
Shunpo
(700)
This
same
technique
can
be
used
to
harass
them
under
their
own
tower
without
taking
tower
hits
as
well.
