Aatrox
the
Darkin
Blade
or
Release
date
Aatrox's
secondary
resource
bar
displays
his
Blood
Well.
Whenever
he
uses
an
ability
that
costs
health,
he
stores
100%
of
the
health
cost
into
it.
The
Blood
Well
can
store
up
to
30
+
(45
×
level)
health.
If
Aatrox
has
not
dealt
nor
received
damage
in
the
last
5
seconds,
his
Blood
Well
will
deplete
at
a
rate
of
2%
per
second.
Aatrox
passively
increases
his
attack
speed
by
/
/
/
/
/
%
for
every
2%
in
the
Blood
Well.
Upon
taking
fatal
damage,
Blood
Well
activates
and
places
Aatrox
in
stasis
for
up
to
3
seconds.
Over
the
stasis
duration
the
Blood
Well
is
emptied
and
Aatrox
restores
health
equal
to
its
contents
plus
10.
+
(15.
×
level).
Aatrox
can
cancel
the
stasis
early
after
1
second
by
moving,
but
this
also
ends
the
health
regeneration.
Additional
Information:
Aatrox
takes
flight
and
slams
down
at
a
targeted
area,
dealing
physical
damage
to
nearby
enemies
upon
landing.
Enemies
in
the
center
of
the
area
are
also
knocked
up
for
1
second.
Additional
Information:
Aatrox
heals
himself
on
every
third
attack.
If

health
he

times
as
much.

unleashes
and

the

few
seconds.
