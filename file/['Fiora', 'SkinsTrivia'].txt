Fiora
was
designed
by
.
Fiora
is
voiced
by
,
who
also
voices
,
,
,
and
.
Fiora's
sword
fighting
style
is
based
on
,
and
her
character
concept
is
inspired
by
an
unspecified
historical
,
possibly
Julie
D'Aubigny.
Fiora
also
has
a
caricatural
French
accent.
The
name
Fiora
derives
from
"Fiore",
the
Italian
word
for
"Flower",
which
may
be
a
reference
to
Fiore
Dei
Liberi,
an
Italian
fencing
master.
"Fioretto"
is
also
Italian
for
one
of
the
three
fencing
disciplines,
namely
the
Foil.
Fiora's
dance
is
a
reference
to
Fred
Astaire's
dance
in
the
movie
,
with
the
song
.
A
side-by-side
comparison
can
be
seen
.
Fiora's
taunt
animation
is
derived
from
the
"salute"
in
honor
duel
tradition
(retained
in
sports
fencing
today);
where
opponents
would
raise
their
swords
to
each
other
at
the
beginning
and
conclusion
of
a
duel,
bout
or
sparring
session.
Pictures
on
her
and
are
not
her
classic
skin,
but
instead
her
Nightraven
skin.
Her
ultimate
is
comparable
to
that
of
Yurnero,
the
Juggernaut
from
,
which
also
pays
homage
to
Final
Fantasy
VII
main
protagonist
Cloud
Strife's
Ability
'Omnislash'.
All
three
consist
of
dancing
across
the
battlefield
slashing
at
random
targets.
Cloud's
moves
can
be
seen
(FF7)
and
(CGI
Movie).
Fiora's
is
very
similar
to
the
of
the
same
name
in
,
with
almost
identical
particles
and
effects.
Fiora's
quote
is
likely
a
reference
to
from
the
movie
.
His
full
quote:
During
Fiora's
jokes,
she
draws
face
in
the
air.
Fiora
is
rivals
with
Jax
and
Lux,
Lux
because
of
her
Crownguard
heritage
as
well
as
being
too
optimistic
for
her.
And
Jax
due
to
him
being
one
of
the
finest
fighters
known
in
Runeterra
with
his
unmatched
mastery
of
weapons.
Royal
Guard
Fiora
is
likely
a
reference
to
the
,
a
fighting
company
of
the
French
monarchy.
In
Nightraven
Fiora's
skin,
the
rapier's
hilt
is
based
on
the
Italian
"Swept
Hilt"
design.
Though
all
of
Fiora's
splash
arts
show
her
with
a
parrying
dagger
in
her
off-hand,
none
of
her
character
models
actually
have
her
holding
the
dagger.
Before
the
announcing
of
the
skin
names,
the
Royal
Guard
skin
was
nicknamed
the
Musketeer
skin
and
the
Nightraven
was
nicknamed
the
Zorro
skin
by
the
community.
Headmistress
Fiora
is
a
reference
to
the
clich√©
most
commonly
occuring
in
American
sitcoms
in
which
a
teacher
would
end
up
being
hugely
attractive
and
would
be
a
flirty
icon
to
either
students
or
parents
or
other
staff.
