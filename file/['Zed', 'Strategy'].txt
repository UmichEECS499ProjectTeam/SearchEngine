An

to

is
another
excellent
core
item
on

since
it
builds

all
of

greatly.
If
while
playing

you
find

Due
to
the
passive
effect
of
his
,
Zed
can
benefit
from
every
AD
item
like
an
AP
champ
would
with
Rabadon's
Deathcap,
and
thus
can
obtain
very
high
amount
of
AD
on
late

With
fully
stacked

and
no
other

items,
he
can
reach
262.5
bonus
AD,
although
stacking
the
Sword
of
the
Occult
and
keeping
it
stacked
can
be
difficult
in
a
lot
of
matches.
The
active

works
surprisingly
well
with
his
Ult

Zed
generally
achieves
high
amounts
of

causing
the

to
deal
high
damage
on
top
of

A
allows
Zed
to
fight
1v1's
extremely
well,
as
it
adds
extra
single
target
damage
that
allows
him
to
keep
on
top
of
his
opponent
aswell
as
increasing
the
total
damage
when
his
Death
Mark
pops.
The
extra
attack
speed
also
allows
him
to
take
down
towers
quickly,
in
combination
with
the
active
allows
him
to
splitpush,
knowing
you'll
be
able
to
kill
most
of
the
things
that
are
sent
at
you.
The
high

can
add
significant
damage
to
the

Zed
starts
auto-attacking
his
target
automatically.
After
the
first
hit,
use
the
active
to
deal
more
damage,
reset
the
attack
timer
and
attack
again.
The
combination
can
be
as
much
as
300%
of
Zed's
AD
in
a
very
short
time.
This
item
also
includes
a
lot
of
extra
wave
clear
for
Zed,
increasing
his
splitpush
potential
further.
If
Zed's
opponents
have
high
amounts
of
crowd
control,
and
he
finds
himself
being
locked
down,
a

can
be
effective,
not
only
reducing
magic
damage
on
him
from
his
opponents,
the
upgrade
gives
him
a
considerable
amount
of
AD.
Once
Zed
has
his

build,
it
is
possible
to
replace
his
boots
with
a
to
increase
his
overall
DPS
in
teamfights
as
it
will
reduce
Crowd
Control
effects
on
him,
as
well
as
making
his
combat
stats
stronger
and
the
10%
movement
speed
makes
up
for
the
amount
lost
from
not
having
boots
fairly
well.
As
some
games
go,
it
is
relatively
more
cost
efficient
to
rush

be
quick
to
focus
on

a
team
fight.

other

before
hitting
your

Escaping
laterally,
rather
than
directly
away,
from
Zed
when
he
uses
his
ultimate
will
slightly
limit
his
ability
to
slow
and
pursue
your
champion.
Be
aware
of
Zed's
clone
as
he
can
use
it
to
mimic
and
even
when
he
is
out
of
sight,
giving
him
deceptively
long
range.
Zed

as
he
will
most
likely
use
