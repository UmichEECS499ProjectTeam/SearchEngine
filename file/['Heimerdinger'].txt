Heimerdinger
grants
himself,
nearby
allied
H-28G
Evolution
Turrets,
and
nearby
allied
champions
/
/
/
/
health
regeneration
per
5
seconds.
Heimerdinger
deploys
a
turret
at
the
target
location.
Heimerdinger
stores
enough
parts
for
a
new
turret
every
several
seconds
(affected
by
cooldown
reduction)
but
can
only
keep
a
limited
number
of
turrets
in
reserve.
Up
to
3
turrets
can
be
deployed
at
a
time
and
deploying
a
fourth
turret
destroys
the
oldest
one.
Turrets
have
a
short-ranged
basic
attack
and
a
long-ranged
laser
beam.
The
laser
beam
is
a
pass-through
skill
shot
that
fires
upon
reaching
100%
charge.
The
recharge
time
is
12
seconds
(affected
by
cooldown
reduction).
Turrets
deactivate
if
Heimerdinger
is
more
than
1000
distance
away
for
longer
than
8
seconds.
Heimerdinger
constructs
an
Apex
Turret
that
lasts
for
8
seconds.
The
Apex
Turret
deals
modified
damage
based
on
the
rank
in
UPGRADE!!!;
gains
a
25%
slow
and
100%
splash
damage
on
its
basic
attacks;
and
the
laser
beam
is
wider
and
takes
half
as
long
to
charge.
The
Apex
Turret
does
not
count
toward
Heimerdinger's
turret
limit,
nor
does
it
interact
with
his
turret
reserve.
Additional
Information:
Heimerdinger
unleashes
a
barrage
of
5
rockets
that
converge
on
the
target
location
and
fan
beyond
it
up
to
a
maximum
range,
each
rocket
dealing
magic
damage
to
the
first
enemy
it
hits.
Enemies
champions
and
neutral
monsters
that
are
hit
by
more
than
one
rocket
take
20%
magic
damage
for
each
rocket
beyond
the
first.
Enemy
minions
take
modified
damage
from
each
rocket.
Heimerdinger
launches
4
waves
of
rockets
in
quick
succession.
Upgraded
rockets
deal
modified
damage
based
on
the
rank
in
UPGRADE!!!.
Additional
Information:
Heimerdinger
hurls
a
grenade
at
a
targeted
location,
dealing
magic
damage
and
slowing
enemies
hit
by
35%
for
2
seconds.
Enemies
struck
directly
by
the
grenade
are
also
stunned
for
1.
seconds.
Heimerdinger
hurls
a
grenade
that
bounces
up
to
3
times,
discharging
on
each
bounce.
Each
discharge
deals
modified
damage
based
on
the
rank
in
UPGRADE!!!,
the
slow
is
increased
to
80%
and
the
area
of
effect
is
larger.
Enemies
can
only
be
damaged
by
the
grenade
once,
but
can
be
slowed
and
stunned
multiple
times
if
circumstances
permit.
Additional
Information:
Heimerdinger
empowers
his
next
basic
ability,
also
making
it
free
to
cast.
Empowered
abilities
share
the
same
cooldown
as
their
basic
form.
After
Heimerdinger
has
had
UPGRADE!!!
active
for
3
seconds
without
using
another
ability,
he
can
reactivate
it
to
cancel
the
empowerment
and
put
UPGRADE!!!
on
a
3
second
static
cooldown.
UPGRADE!!!
will
only
go
on
its
normal
cooldown
if
Heimerdinger
used
an
empowered
ability.
