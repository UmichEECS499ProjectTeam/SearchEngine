http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Quinn/Background
As
a
young
girl,
Quinn
shared
a
hunger
for
adventure
with
her
twin
brother.
They
dreamed
of
becoming
knights,
but
lived
a
quiet,
humble
life
in
the
rural
borderlands
of
Demacia.
Together
they
imagined
triumphant
battles
in
faraway
lands,
seizing
glory
for
their
king
and
slaying
foes
in
the
name
of
Demacian
justice.
When
daydreams
alone
could
no
longer
satisfy
their
warriors
souls,
they
embarked
on
daring
wilderness
adventures
in
search
of
true
danger.
One
such
quest
turned
to
tragedy
when
a
terrible
accident
claimed
her
brother's
life.
Overcome
with
grief,
Quinn
abandoned
her
dreams
of
knighthood.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
loss,
Quinn
gathered
the
courage
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy.
To
her
surprise,
she
found
a
wounded
Demacian
eagle
at
the
site
of
her
brother's
death
-
a
rare
and
beautiful
bird
long
believed
extinct.
Quinn
nursed
the
fledgling
back
to
health,
and
as
they
grew
up
together,
a
deep
bond
formed
between
the
two.
She
saw
the
same
quality
in
her
newfound
friend
that
had
lived
within
her
brother,
and
so
she
gave
him
the
name
"Valor."
The
pair
found
strength
in
each
other,
and
together
they
pursued
the
dream
she
had
once
abandoned.
The
Demacian
army
had
never
seen
heroes
like
Quinn
and
Valor.
Their
deadly
skills
quickly
set
them
apart
from
their
rank-and-file
peers,
but
many
still
had
their
doubts.
How
could
a
common-born
girl,
even
with
such
a
powerful
creature
at
her
side,
forego
years
of
military
training?
Quinn
and
Valor
proved
themselves
on
one
critical
mission,
tracking
down
a
assassin
who
had
evaded
an
entire
Demacian
battalion.
When
they
brought
him
to
justice,
they
finally
earned
the
admiration
and
respect
of
their
nation.
The
two
now
serve
as
living,
fighting
icons
of
Demacian
strength
and
perseverance.
Together,
Quinn
and
Valor
will
stand
against
any
threat
to
their
beloved
home.

Announcement
made
by
:
Quinn
and
Valor,
Demacia’s
Wings,
will
be
swooping
onto
the
Fields
of
Justice
in
the
upcoming
patch.
The
most
comprehensive
duo
to
grace
League
of
Legends
yet,
Quinn
and
Valor
work
in
tandem
to
punish
their
opponents
through
agile
and
precise
attacks.
Quinn
and
Valor’s
combined
prowess
makes
them
a
highly
mobile
carry
combo.
During
the
laning
stage,
the
passive
effects
from
Harrier
and
Heightened
Senses
make
Quinn
an
excellent
last-hitter,
and
raises
the
chances
of
the
duo
securing
kills
against
enemy
champions.
Quinn
and
Valor
also
enjoy
a
range
of
defensive
abilities:
Quinn
can
activate
Heightened
Senses
to
check
for
approaching
junglers,
while
Vault
ensures
Quinn
can
easily
maintain
safe
distance
when
enemies
come
in
for
the
kill.
If
an
opponent
is
still
able
to
close
in,
the
blind
from
Blinding
Assault
can
briefly
neutralize
the
enemy
and
allow
for
a
hasty
retreat.
Quinn
and
Valor
are
also
highly
capable
when
assisting
friendly
ganks.
The
slow
from
Vault
makes
their
target
susceptible
to
skillshots,
and
grants
valuable
time
to
secure
a
kill
before
your
enemy
can
escape.
The
best
Quinn
and
Valor
players
can
even
use
smart
positioning
and
timing
with
Vault
to
launch
Quinn
over
terrain.
Quinn
and
Valor
also
excel
at
chasing
down
fleeing
enemies.
Activating
Heightened
Senses
gives
vision
across
terrain
and
into
brush,
allowing
the
duo
to
close
in
on
enemies
attempting
to
juke.
Meanwhile,
the
speed
bonus
from
Tag
Team
helps
Valor
hunt
down
retreating
prey
before
Quinn
returns
to
Skystrike
for
the
killing
blow.
The
nature
of
Quinn
and
Valor’s
play
changes
fundamentally
once
you
gain
access
to
Tag
Team.
While
still
a
disruptive
ranged
duo,
Tag
Team
temporarily
turns
Valor
into
a
melee
monster,
perfectly
poised
for
pursuing
wounded
enemies
and
cleaning
up
team
fights.
As
a
lengthy
buff,
Tag
Team
affords
Valor
enough
time
to
zip
between
lanes
to
defend
or
split
push
as
needed.
The
long
duration
also
means
Valor
can
fully
disengage
from
a
team
fight,
reposition
and
heal
up
if
needed,
and
re-enter
the
fight
once
the
conditions
are
more
favorable.
Quinn
and
Valor
operate
as
an
extremely
powerful
and
mobile
team,
perfect
for
new
players
and
veterans
looking
to
carry
in
League
of
Legends!
Noxian
Quinn
and
Valor
are
an
elite
ranger
team.
With
crossbow
and
claw,
they
undertake
their
most
dangerous
missions
deep
within
enemy
territory,
from
swift
reconnaissance
to
lethal
strikes.
The
pair's
unbreakable
bond
is
deadly
on
the
battlefield,
leaving
opponents
blind
and
riddled
with
arrows
long
before
they
realize
who
they're
fighting:
not
one,
but
two
legends.

"Most
soldiers
only
rely
on
their
weapons.
Few
truly
rely
on
each

―
"Justice

"Just

"You

the

Val."
"Still

"Fly

"Stay
on

"I'll
follow
your
lead,
Valor."
"Find

"A

the
best

"We're

together."
"Demacia
is
counting
on
us."
"We've

"Stay

"Buy

again."
"There's

"Sometimes
I

that
bird
is
just
showing
off."
"I

"Stick

"We

"Demacia
needs

"Who's

who?
Uh,
Valor!"
"Who's
there?
Fiora
who?
Valor,
that's
just
mean!"
"Who's
there?
Garen
who?
Yeah,
I
guess
he
does
say
that
a
lot."
"I'd
keep
my
head
down
if
I
were
you."
"I've

friends
in

is

you'll

"Go

"Gouge
'em,

"What
do
you
see
up
there?"
"Need
eyes
on
'em!"
"Eyes
in
the
sky."
"Now!"
"Valor,
to
me!"

They

the
legions

and

They
are
the
beacons
of

They
bear
the
standard.
They

the
charge.
Demacia
has
always
stood
a
stalwart
sentinel
against
darkness
and
evil,
but
the
nation
faces
a
world
of
new
and
terrible
threats.
They
wield
the
sword

spear,
marching
against
their
foes
in
mighty
numbers,
but
can
an
army
catch
an
assassin?
Can
numbers
alone
hold
back
spells
woven
in
shadow
and
flame?
With
such
vicious
forces
bearing
down
upon
her
doorstep,
how
will
Demacia
endure?
The
answer
is
simple:
a
new
champion
approaches.
She
is
a
new
kind
of
hero,
one
of
new
mind
and
new
method.
One
who
can
go
where
armies
cannot
reach,
where
swords
cannot
clash.
This
is
her
story.
Her
worth
will
be
tested,
her
ways
will
be
questioned,
but
she
will
forge
ahead.
Honor
guides
her
path.
Justice
steadies
her
aim.
Valor
is
the
only
ally
she
needs.
