Talon
the
Blade's
Shadow
or
Release
date
Talon's
autoattacks
deal
10%
additional
damage
to
any
target
that
is
slowed,
stunned,
immobilized
or
suppressed.
Talon's
next
autoattack
within
the
next
6
seconds
deals
bonus
physical
damage.
If
the
target
is
a
champion
they
will
also
bleed
for
6
seconds,
granting
sight
of
their
location
to
Talon
and
taking
additional
physical
damage
each
second
for
the
duration.
Additional
Information:
Talon
sends
out
a
volley
of
daggers
in
a
cone
that
then
quickly
return
back
to
him,
dealing
physical
damage
to
any
enemies
it
passes
through.
Each
enemy
can
only
be
damaged
once
at
the
start
of
the
ability
and
once
at
the
end.
Additionally
the
enemy
is
slowed
for
2
seconds,
refreshing
the
duration
of
the
slow
if
they
are
hit
twice.
Additional
Information:
Talon
instantly
appears
behind
his
target,
silencing
them
for
1
second
and
amplifying
his
damage
against
that
target
for
3
seconds.
Talon
disperses
blades
outwards
in
a
500-radius
ring
and
gains
stealth
for
up
to
2.5
seconds
while
gaining
40%
movement
speed.
When
Talon
emerges
from
stealth,
the
blades
converge
on
his
location.
When
the
ring
of
blades
expands
and
contracts,
enemies
hit
receive
physical
damage.
Each
enemy
can
only
be
damaged
once
at
the
start
of
the
ability
and
once
at
the
end.
