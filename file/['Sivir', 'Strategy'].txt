During

However,
the
mana
cost
of
this
playstyle
is
extremely
high,
due
to
Sivir's
small
mana
pool.
Despite
being
a
champion
with
relatively
high
mana
costs
and
effective
lane
zoning,
Sivir
can
easily
and
effectively
be
adapted
to

in
an
aggressive
lane
with
supports
such
as

and
Leona
with

few
simple
changes

Getting

very
helpful,
as
with
a
bit
of
practice
you
will
be
able
to
use

negate

With
experience
you
can
avoid

recover

Sivir
is
fairly
squishy
in
the
lane.
Putting
a
pressure
on
her
can
make
her
underfarmed
or
underleveled.
Sivir
deals
entirely
physical
damage,
and
much
of
that
damage
is
dealt
through
autoattacks.
Consider
buying
armor
if
she
begins
to

too
much
damage.
Avoid
taking

don't

Sivir
is
often
very
attack
speed
oriented.
As
a
tank,
grabbing

be
a
very
effective
counter

and
champions
like

who
can
slow

are
also
nice
counter-picks
to
her.
Although
Sivir
is
a
carry,
she
is
still
fairly
powerful
early
game.
Her
hits
hard
if
she
lands
both

exclusively,
and

specialized
for

Taking
her

in
a
long
trip
back
from
your
nexus.
