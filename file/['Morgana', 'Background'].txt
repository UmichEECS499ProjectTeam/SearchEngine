"There
is
no
rest
while
Kayle's
brand
of
tyranny
still
exists."
â€•
fallen
While
some
call
Morgana
'fallen',
she
enjoys
more
clearly
defining
this
status
to
her
enemies.
"We'll
bring
them
pain."
"I'll
have
my
revenge."
"They
will
suffer."
"Without
mercy."
"Share
in
my
torment!"
"Do
not
dally!"
"Feel
my
pain."
"You
too
will
be
judged."
"Not
all
angels
are
good."
Morgana
laughs.
Morgana
laughs.
Morgana
laughs.
Morgana
was
designed
by
as
well
as
and
was
remade
by
:'
