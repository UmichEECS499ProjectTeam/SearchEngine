One
of
the
reasons
Piltover
is
known
as
the
City
of
Progress
is
because
it
has
an
extraordinarily
low
crime
rate.
This
hasn't
always
been
the
case;
brigands
and
thieves
of
all
sorts
used
to
find
the
city-state
an
ideal
mark
for
plunder,
primarily
due
to
the
valuable
resources
it
imports
to
fuel
its
techmaturgical
research.
Some
even
theorize
that
it
would
have
fallen
long
ago
to
the
chaos
of
organized
crime
if
not
for
Caitlyn,
the
Sheriff
of
Piltover.
Born
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
statesman
and
a
pioneering
hextech
researcher,
Caitlyn
discovered
her
natural
gift
for
investigation
when,
at
age
14,
her
father
was
assaulted
and
robbed
on
his
way
home.
She
snuck
out
of
her
house
that
night
with
her
father's
rifle
and
tracked
down
the
muggers
from
the
crime
scene.
At
first,
her
parents
did
their
best
to
discourage
her
from
such
risky
hobbies,
but
she
was
incorrigible.
Wishing
to
protect
her
daughter
in
the
only
way
she
knew
how,
Caitlyn's
mother
began
outfitting
her
with
techmaturgical
devices
tailored
to
her
sleuthing
needs.
Caitlyn
quickly
gained
notoriety,
both
because
she
was
single
handedly
defeating
crime
in
Piltover
and
also
because
she
soon
developed
into
a
ravishing
beauty.
She
never
backed
down
from
a
case
or
a
challenge,
and
she
was
one
of
the
sharpest
shots
in
the
city-state.
Her
services
were
soon
requested
by
Demacia
to
help
track
down
a
mysterious
outlaw
who
had
begun
committing
high-profile
heists.
The
bandit,
who
always
left
a
card
with
an
ornate
'C'
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
became
Caitlyn's
arch-nemesis.
To
this
day,
Caitlyn
still
searches
for
this
cat
burglar,
and
the
chase
has
led
her
all
across
Valoran.
She
has
joined
the
League
to
hone
her
skills
and
gain
the
influence
necessary
to
track
down
the
only
quarry
that
has
managed
to
evade
her.

Go
ahead,
run.
I'll
give
you
a
five
minute
head
start.
"I'm
on
the
case."
"Got
them
in
my
sights."
"Meet
the
long
gun
of
the
law."
"Boom.
Headshot."
"So
many
bad
guys,
so
little
time."
"Who
doesn't
like
being
under
the
gun?"
"Up
for
a
showdown?"
"Sorry
boys,
I
keep
the
fuzzy
cuffs
at
home."
"Hot
on
the
trail."
"I
love
a
good
chase."
"Don't
be
caught
flat
footing."
"I
have
the
tools
for
the
job."
"Wanna
see
a
hat
trick?"
"Let's
investigate."
"Time
for
a
shakedown."
"Me,
miss?
Not
by
a
long
shot."
"Right."
"Want
another
shot?
I
wouldn't
want
to
leave
things
up
in
the
air."
"Would
you
prefer
the
good
cop,
or
the
bad
cop?"
"A
sniper's
greatest
tool
is
precision...
and
good
equipment."
"The
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its...
parts."
Caitlyn
laughs.

"Calibrating."
"Steady..."
"In

"Nowhere
to
hide."

Officials

issue
a
statement

all
of
you.
It
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
there
is
a
new
sheriff
in
town.
The
beautiful
(and
stylish)
Caitlyn,
the
Sheriff
of
Piltover,
has
arrived
at
the
League
of
Legends,
so
bandits,
ruffians,
rabble-rousers,
and
otherwise
uncouth
persons
beware!
Of
course,
even
if

one
look
at
her
and
you
might
not
want
to
escape
anymore.
Of
course,
you
don’t
need
to
have
a
warrant
out
for
your
arrest
to
get
a
closer
look
at
this
