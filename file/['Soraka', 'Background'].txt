"The
cruelty
of
one
will
not
blind
me
to
the
suffering
of
many."
Soraka's
lore
was
officially
updated
on
September
18
,
2012
"Though
having
fallen
from
grace,
Soraka
is
nonetheless
determined
to
once
again
be
one
with
the
stars."

"Let
me
guide
you."
"By
the
power
of
the
stars."
"They
will
know
serenity."
"Be
at
peace."
"Violence
cannot
go
unanswered."
"They
will
go
no
further."
"What
must
be
done."
"Such
hatred
in
their
hearts."
"This
is
my
path."
"For
peace
of
mind."
"Gracefully."
"Where
am
I
needed?"
"I
heed
their
call."
"Every
step;
a
new
journey."
"To
heal
and
protect."
"Never
waste
a
breath."
"The
whole
world
in
balance."
"I
lend
my
aid."
"No,
I'm
not
happy
to
see
you.
Yes,
that
is
a
horn
growing
out
of
my
head."
"Yes,
that
was
a
banana.
*giggles*
No
one
expects
the
banana."
"Do
you
always
fight
so
poorly?"
"I
will
not
save
you."'
Soraka
laughs.

"Stars
hear
me!"
"Live!"
"For
life!"
"Have
hope!"
Soraka
was
designed
by
.
The
stars
themselves
have
conspired
to
reform
Soraka
into
a
mighty
battle
cleric.
An
empyrean
being
of
grace
and
poise,
Celestine
Soraka
radiates
with
new
particles
and
effects.
New
animations
grace
the
Star
Child,
too:
Celestine
Soraka
levitates
towards
the
heavens
as
she
returns
to
base,
and
when
she
is
taken
in
battle,
she
dissipates
into
stardust
before
readying
for
her
return
to
the
Fields
of
Justice.
We're
thrilled
to
announce
that
the
stars
have
aligned
and
Soraka
will
soon
be
receiving
a
massive
visual
upgrade.
Her
classic
look
and
skins
will
feature
all-new
models
with
revamped
animations,
visual
effects
and
VO
along
with
stunning
splash
art
to
introduce
you
to
her
new
look.
Note
that
the
ability
is
still
free
to
cast
on
enemies.
