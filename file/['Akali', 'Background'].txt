A
prodigious
martial
artist,
Akali
began
training
with
her
mother
as
soon
as
she
could
make
a
fist.
Her
mother's
discipline
was
relentless
and
unforgiving,
but
predicated
on
the
fundamental
principle:
"We
do
that
which
must
be
done."
When
the
inducted
her
into
the
order
at
the
age
of
fourteen,
she
could
slice
a
dangling
chain
with
a
chop
of
her
hand.
There
was
no
question
–
she
would
succeed
her
mother
as
the
Fist
of
Shadow.
She
has
had
to
do
much
in
this
role
which
others
might
find
morally
questionable,
but
to
her
it
is
in
service
of
her
mother's
inviolable
doctrine.
She
now
works
with
her
fellows
and
to
enforce
the
balance
of
Valoran.
This
hallowed
pursuit
has
unsurprisingly
led
the
triumvirate
to
the

There
exists
an
ancient
order
originating
in
the
Isles
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
balance.
Order,
chaos,
light,
darkness
-
all
things
must
exist
in
perfect
harmony
for
such
is
the
way
of
the
universe.
This
order
is
known
as
the
and
it
employs
a
triumvirate
of
shadow
warriors
to
uphold
its
causes
in
the
world.
Akali
is
one
of
these
shadow
warriors,
entrusted
with
the
sacred
duty
of
Pruning

Tree
-
eliminating
those
who
threaten
the
equilibrium

"The
Fist
of
Shadow
strikes
from
the
cover
of
death
itself.
Do
not
impede
the
balance."
"As
balance
dictates."
"Without
question."
"Whatever's
necessary."
"Mark
acquired."
"Another
unworthy
opponent."
"A
necessary
sacrifice."
"Honor
is
the
blade's
edge."
"Deftly
I
travel."
"Understood."
"Through
Twilight's
veil."
"Tread
lightly."
"Agreed."
"Remain
focused."
"Hesitation
is
the
seed
of
defeat."
"Symmetry
in
all
things."
"We
travel
the
same
path."
"I
suggest
you
run...
I
want
to
savor
this."
"So
many
noobs...
will
matchmaking
ever
find
true
balance?"

[...]So,
now
that
we’ve
covered
the
basics,
what
are
some
other
things
that
have
a
tendency
to
appear
in
threes?
Well
in
response
to
the
community
concerns
surrounding
's
ninja
status,
we’ve
added
a
to
the
mix
to
promote
the
spirit
of
friendly
competition.
But
even
with
a
yordle
already
competing
for
assignments
with
the
infamous
Eye
of
Twilight,
there’s
got
to
be
room
for
a
little
feminine
energy
in
any
self-respecting
ninja
organization,
right?
What
the
Kinkou
Order
without
a
dash
of
the
classic
femme
fatale,
right?
Could
it
be…
three
ninjas?!
Rule
of
threes!
Summoners
of
Valoran,
the
Kinkou
Order
of
the
Isles
wanted
me
to
reinforce
to
you
that
they
are
an
equal
opportunity
employer!
While
by
now
you've
all
witnessed
the
awesome
power
of
and
on
the
Field
of
Justice,
none
of
you
have
yet
run
afoul
of
the
Fist
of
Shadow.
Which
is
fortunate
for
all
of
you,
since
ninja
academies
are
really
only
discerning
about
one
thing:
the
lethality
of
their
students!
And
this
is
one
lady
ninja
who
doesn't
like
to
disappoint
her
instructors!
