As
improbable
as
it
was
for
a
child
to
survive
in
the
inhospitable
jungle
by
herself,
she
did
just
that.
Her
youthful
innocence
and
a
fortunate
naivete
caused
her
to
appeal
to
the
beasts
of
that
place
and
she
was
taken
in
by
a
family
of
cougars
and
raised
as
one
of
their
own.
She
grew
and
somehow
absorbed
the
raw
magic
of
the
dense
wilds,
evolving
beyond
both
her
human
physiology
and
her
feline
affectation.
On
one
pivotal
day
in
her
life,
standing
over
the
torn
remnants
of
a
squad
of
woodcutters,
Nidalee
chose
to
rejoin
the
so-called
civilized
world,
to
fight
in
so
as
to
protect
the
vast
woods
from
both
and
Noxus.

There
are
few
dwellers,
let
alone
,
residing
in
the
blasted
and
dangerous
lands
that
lie
south
of
the
Great
Barrier.
Much
of
that
world
still
bears
the
scars
of
past
Rune
Wars,
especially
the
mysterious
Kumungu
Jungle.
There
are
long-forgotten
treasures
in
these
strange
places
which
many
risk
life
and
limb
to
acquire.
The
champion
known
as
Nidalee
was
only
a
young
girl
traveling
with
her
treasure-seeking
parents
when
they
lost
their
way
in
the
dense,
rainy
jungles.
The
jungle
was
unforgiving,
and
she
watched
her
parents
suffer
agonizing
final
days
as
they
fell
victim
to
a
mysterious
and
vicious
disease.

"Nidalee
was
taught
to
fight
by
her
feline
family,
battling
viciously
with
tooth
and
nail.
Something
in
her
feline
ways
may
draw
you
to
her,
but
remember
that
she
is
no
pussycat."
"They
will
fear
the
wild."
"Claw
or
spear,
your
end's
the
same."
"Mmm,
the
taste
of
coward."
Nidalee
hisses.
"We'll
prey
on
the
civilized."
"I'll
show
these
house
cats
real
claws."
"The
untamed
know
no
fear."
"I
will
guide
you."
"Let
me
show
you
the
way."
"On
the
prowl."
"You
call
this
civilized?"
"You
cannot
cage
me,
summoner."
"Instinct
guides
my
steps."
"Here
mousy,
mousy,
mousy..."
"Did
I
mention
it's
mating
season?"

laughs.
