Born
to
the
prestigious
Crownguards,
the
paragon
family
of
service,
Luxanna
was
destined
for
greatness.
She
grew
up
as
the
family’s
only
daughter,
and
she
immediately
took
to
the
advanced
education
and
lavish
parties
required
of
families
as
high
profile
as
the
Crownguards.
As
Lux
matured,
it
became
clear
that
she
was
extraordinarily
gifted.
She
could
play
tricks
that
made
people
believe
they
had
seen
things
that
did
not
actually
exist.
She
could
also
hide
in
plain
sight.
Somehow,
she
was
able
to
reverse
engineer
arcane
magical
spells
after
seeing
them
cast
only
once.
She
was
hailed
as
a
prodigy,
drawing
the
affections
of
the
Demacian
government,
military,
and
citizens
alike.
As
one
of
the
youngest
women
to
be
tested
by
the
College
of
Magic,
she
was
discovered
to
possess
a
unique
command
over
the
powers
of
light.
The
young
Lux
viewed
this
as
a
great
gift,
something
for
her
to
embrace
and
use
in
the
name
of
good.
Realizing
her
unique
skills,
the
Demacian
military
recruited
and
trained
her
in
covert
operations.
She
quickly
became
renowned
for
her
daring
achievements;
the
most
dangerous
of
which
found
her
deep
in
the
chambers
of
the
High
Command.
She
extracted
valuable
inside
information
about
the
-
conflict,
earning
her
great
favor
with
Demacians
and
Ionians
alike.
However,
reconnaissance
and
surveillance
was
not
for
her.
A
light
of
her
people,
Lux's
true
calling
was
,
where
she
could
follow
in
her
brother’s
footsteps
and
unleash
her
gifts
as
an
inspiration
for
all
of
Demacia.
Announcement
made
in
the
sneak
peek
by
:
Demacian
Noxian
Noxus
Ionian
the
League
of
Legends
"Her
guiding
light
makes
enemies
wary,
but
they
should
worry
most
when
the
light
fades."
―
"Tactical
decision,
summoner!"
"Illuminate
the
enemy!"
"Banish
the
shadows!"
"Light
'em
up!"
"Focus
on
the
battle."
"With
superior
tactics."
"I
never
think
about
losing."
"I'll
look
into
it."
"Going!"
"I
love
it
when
a
plan
comes
together."
"Lighting
the
way."
"We
can
do
this."
"Stay
positive."
"Bright
decision!"
"With
your
power
level,
I
suggest
you
forfeit
instead."
"In
the
name
of
Demacia,
I
will
punish
you!"
"Double
rainbow?
What
does
it
mean?..."
"Well,
a
"double
rainbow"
is
a
phenomenon
of
optics
that
displays
a
spectrum
of
light
due
to
the
sun
shining
on
droplets
of
moisture
in
the
atmosphere.
Does
that
explain
it?"
"Light
mage?
I'm
just
an
ordinary
mage."
Shhh!
I'm
charging
my
laser..."
Lux
laughs.
Lux
laughs.
Lux
laughs.
Lux
laughs.
"Demacia!"
The
truest
opponent
lies
within.
Lux
was
designed
by
If
Swain
was
a
bit
dark
for
your
taste,
then
this
next
champion
ought
to
be
more
your
speed.
She'll
be
a
real
ray
of
light
into
your
otherwise
dreary
day.
Allow
me
to
introduce
Lux,
the
Lady
of
Luminosity.
Representing
the
City-state
of
Demacia,
Lux
is
not
only
the
latest
champion
to
grace
the
Field
of
Justice,
but
also
the
sister
of
everyone's
favorite
Might
of
Demacia,
Garen.
Whether
you're
a
strong
believer
in
sibling
rivalry
or
just
want
to
keep
it
in
the
family,
Lux
should
make
the
perfect
addition
to
your
champion
collection.
