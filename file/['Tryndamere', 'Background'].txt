"Rage
is
my
weapon."
―
"The
next
true
power
will
come
from
the
far
north,
and
it
will
involve
Tryndamere
-
one
way
or
another."
―
"Beware
of
Tryndamere!
His
sword
appeases
the
hunger
of
the
soul-devouring
dead."
"This'll
be
a
slaughter."
"Now
they
die!"
"I
am
your
worst
nightmare!"
"This'll
be
a
slaughter."
"As
you
wish."
"Into
battle."
"Follow
my
blade!"
"You
never
stood
a
chance."
"My
right
arm
is
a
lot
stronger
than
my
left
arm!"
Tryndamere
laughs.

"The
thirst
consumes
me!"
"Slaughter!
Massacre..."
"Claim
them
all."
"Devour
their
souls."
"They
will
serve
us."
"No
control!
No...
mercy."
"Rivers
of
blood."
"Must...
go."
"Find
fresh
souls.
Quickly."
"No
salvation."
"I
am
your
worst
nightmare!"
"All
will
be
consumed."
"Soon
all
will
join
me."
"There
is
no
going
back."
"The
power...
is
undeniable."
"We
are
one
now."
"Who
will
be
next?!"
"Yours
will
be
a
small
sacrifice."
"My
blade
calls,
you
will
answer!"
"You
really
don't
want
to
get
on
my
bad
side."
"This
new
look...
is
really
growing
on
me."

Tryndamere
was
designed
by
Summoners!
There's
something
lurking
in
the
trees
of
Summoner's
Rift.
Something
so
vile,
so
menacing,
and
so
terrifying
that
even
the
bravest
of
champions
dare
not
set
foot
in
the
jungle.
It's
been
said
that
wolves,
golems,
and
dragons
have
been
going
missing,
and
that
even
the
dreaded
Baron
Nashor
fears
for
his
life.
While
no
one
is
sure
exactly
who
or
what
is
responsible
for
the
disappearances,
a
strange
figure
has
been
spotted
moving
ever
so
methodically
through
the
woods.
We
manage
to
capture
this
photograph
of
him
before
he
disappeared
again
into
the
brush.
This
week,
three
champions
of
the
League
disappeared
in
the
woods
near
Summoners
Rift
amid
whispers
of
a
powerful
artifact
had
been
spotted.
These
intrepid
treasure
hunters
struck
off
into
the
jungle,
disregarding
rumors
of
strange
happenings,
abnormal
behavior
among
the
wildlife,
and
a
mysterious
presence
so
terrifying
that
even
the
most
courageous
dare
not
speak
its
name.
Today,
after
a
search
party
was
dispatched,
their
remains
were
found!
This
is
their
story!
For
the
launch
of
League
of
Legends
in
Turkey,
Tryndamere
is
shedding
his
barbarian
armor
for
a
more
traditional
Turkish
wardrobe.
Sultan
Tryndamere
comes
equipped
with
Turkish
garb,
a
new
model,
a
new
critical
hit
animation,
and
a
Turkish-inspired,
ornate
scimitar
that
kicks
up
dust
as
it
drags
on
the
ground.
Best
of
all,
Sultan
Tryndamere
has
meticulously
trimmed
his
moustache
for
a
more
distinguished
rampage.
Don’t
miss
this
opportunity
to
save
on
your
new
scimitar
before
you
charge
into
battle
with
Sultan
Tryndamere!
