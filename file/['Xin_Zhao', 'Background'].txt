Whenever
Jarvan
III,
the
king
of
,
delivers
one
of
his
rallying
speeches
from
the
glinting
marble
balcony
atop
the
Royal
Palace,
Xin
Zhao
is
at
his
side.
Coined
the
Seneschal
of
Demacia,
Xin
Zhao
is
the
personal
steward
of
the
Lightshield
Dynasty.
His
enigmatic,
silent
vigil
has
led
to
an
abundance
of
conjecture
concerning
his
“secret
life”
and
origins.
Whether
it’s
"
double-agent"
tendered
at
the
dinner
table
or
"indebted
rune
mage"
mused
in
the
editorials
of
the
Demacian
Constant,
Xin
Zhao
betrays
no
hints
to
sate
the
curiosity
of
the
masses…for
good
reason.
Prior
to
the
formation
of
,
was
renowned
for
a
spectacle
called
The
Fleshing.
It
was
a
gladiatorial
event
with
a
cruel
twist:
as
a
fighter
won
matches,
his
number
of
opponents
(generally
prisoners
of
war)
fought
simultaneously
would
increase.
This
meant
eventual
death
for
every
contender,
but
with
unparalleled
glory.
Xin
Zhao,
known
then
as
Viscero,
was
slated
to
face
300
soldiers,
nearly
six
times
the
previous
record.
This
was
clearly
meant
to
be
his
final
match.
Jarvan
II,
hearing
of
this
unprecedented
feat,
infiltrated
the
arena
to
offer
him
an
alternative:
serve
Demacia
and
punish
those
who
ultimately
sentenced
him
to
death
in
exchange
for
his
freedom.
Xin
Zhao
accepted,
astonished
that
a
king
would
risk
his
own
life
on
his
behalf.
Under
the
cover
of
a
prearranged
Demacian
assault
on
Noxus,
Jarvan
liberated
Xin
Zhao
and
his
300
opponents.
During
their
retreat,
Xin
Zhao
took
a
poisoned
dart
meant
for
Jarvan.
This
act
of
loyalty,
from
a
man
who
vowed
no
allegiance,
earned
Xin
Zhao
a
spot
at
his
side
until
the
day
the
king
died.
Now
in
the
service
of
his
son,
Jarvan
III,
Xin
Zhao
is
stepping
into
a
new
ring
–
the
–
to
fight
for
his
adopted
country
and
to
honor
the
legacy
of
the
man
who
gave
purpose
to
his
life.
Xin
Zhao
was
first
shown
by
some
players
of
the
Community,
which
found
his
Sound-files
and
other
elements
of
him
in
the
data.
He
was
at
PCGamer.com
on
the
2nd
July
2010
,
which
also
included
a
rough
description
of
how
a
champion
is
created
by
Tom
Cadwell.
It
was
announced
on
the
front
page
on
July
7th,
2010.

Funny

Horrible
