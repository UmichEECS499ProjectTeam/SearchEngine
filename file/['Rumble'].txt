all
his
basic
attacks
deal
additional
magic
damage.
While
not
overheated,
after
4
seconds
of
not
using
his
basic
abilities
he
will
start
losing
Heat
at
a
rate
of
10
Heat
per
second,
then
at
a
rate
of
20
Heat
per
second
2.
seconds
later.
When
Rumble
reaches
100
Heat
he
overheats
for
6
seconds.
While
overheated
Rumble
cannot
use
his
own
spells,
but
his
basic
attacks
deal
an
additional
20
+
(5
Ã—
level)
magic
damage.
Rumble's
Heat
is
reset
to
0
after
the
overheat
effect
ends.

pulls
up
a
shield,
protecting

burst
of
speed
for
1
second.

Rumble
shoots
a
taser
that
deals
magic
damage
and
applies
a
slow
on
the
first
enemy
it
hits
for
3
seconds.
A
second
shot
can
be
fired
for
no
additional
cost
within
the
next

even
if

overheats.

the
second
taser
slows
an

that
has
been
slowed
by
the
first,
the

is
refreshed
and
its
movement
speed
reduction
is
doubled.

in
the
"Danger
Zone",
the
damage
and
slow
percentage
are
increased

down
a
line
of
rockets
over

linear
location,
using
a
click
and
drag
targeting
system.

leave
a
