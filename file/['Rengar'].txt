Rengar
the
Pridestalker
or
Release
date
Rengar's
abilities
have
no
cost
related
to
them
and
their
use
is
limited
only
by
cooldowns.
Instead,
he
uses
his
secondary
resource
bar
to
display
his
unique
mechanic:
Ferocity.
Rengar
builds
1
point
of
Ferocity
whenever
he
lands
an
ability.
Upon
reaching
5
Ferocity,
Rengar
gains
the
ability
to
cast
an
alternate
set
of
abilities,
which
are
empowered
versions
of
his
basic
abilities.
The
two
ability-sets
do
not
share
cooldowns,
and
his
basic
abilities'
cooldowns
will
continue
to
count
down
while
his
empowered
abilities
are
available.
His
empowered
abilities
have
no
cooldown
and
can
be
used
whenever
5
Ferocity
is
available,
though
using
an
empowered
ability
consumes
all
5
Ferocity.
While
in
brush
or
in
stealth,
Rengar
gains
bonus
attack
range
and
his
attacks
cause
him
to
leap
at
his
target.
This
bonus
lasts
for
~0.5
second
upon
exiting
brush
or
stealth.
This
will
happen
regardless
of
whether
or
not
his
target
has
sight
of
him,
and
has
no
internal
cooldown.
Rengar's
next
basic
attack
in
the
next
2
seconds
deals
bonus
physical
damage
and
grants
him
increased
attack
speed
for
4
seconds.
Savagery
deals
additional
damage
equal
to
100%
of
Rengar's
attack
damage,
and
he
gains
increased
attack
speed
equal
to
double
the
normal
bonus.
Basic
and
Empowered
Savagery's
attack
speed
bonuses
can
overlap
and
stack
with
each
other.
Rengar
lets
out
a
battle
roar,
dealing
magic
damage
to
nearby
enemies.
If
an
enemy
is
hit
by
Battle
Roar,
Rengar
also
gains
bonus
armor
and
magic
resist
for
3
seconds.
Battle
Roar
also
heals
Rengar
for
20
+
(10
Ã—
level)
health,
increased
by
1%
for
every
1%
of
Rengar's
missing
health,
regardless
of
whether
the
ability
hits
an
enemy
or
not.
Basic
and
Empowered
Battle
Roar's
defense
bonuses
do
not
stack
with
each
other.
Rengar
throws
a
bola
at
his
target,
dealing
physical
damage
and
slowing
it
for
2.5
seconds.
The
slow
decays
over
the
duration.
Bola
Strike
initially
roots
his
target
for
1
second.
The
slow
is
then
applied
in
full
after
the
1
second,
and
decays
over
the
remaining
1.
seconds.
Rengar
activates
his
predatory
instincts,
stealthing
himself
after
1
second
(delayed
up
to
3
seconds
if
taking
damage)
and
revealing
all
enemy
Champions
in
a
large
radius
around
him.
He
gains
movement
speed
and
generates
1
Ferocity
per
0.
second
while
stealthed.
Lasts
7
seconds
or
until
Rengar
uses
an
ability.
If
Rengar
has
a
with
14
trophies,
the
duration
is
increased
to
10
seconds.
Additionally,
Rengar's
next
ability
used
after
activating
Thrill
of
the
Hunt
generates
1
bonus
Ferocity.
Rengar
has
access
to
a
unique
item:
5
,
2
attack
damage
per
level
Kills
and
assists
grant

permanently
grants
